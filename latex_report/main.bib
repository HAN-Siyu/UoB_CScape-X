abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted significant attention in recent years due to their important roles in many biological processes. Domestic animals constitute a unique resource for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and are ideal models relevant to diverse areas of biomedical research. With improving sequencing technologies, numerous domestic-animal lncRNAs are now available. Thus, there is an immediate need for a database resource that can assist researchers to store, organize, analyze and visualize domestic-animal lncRNAs.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The domestic-animal lncRNA database, named ALDB, is the first comprehensive database with a focus on the domestic-animal lncRNAs. It currently archives 12,103 pig intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), 8,923 chicken lincRNAs and 8,250 cow lincRNAs. In addition to the annotations of lincRNAs, it offers related data that is not available yet in existing lncRNA databases (lncRNAdb and NONCODE), such as genome-wide expression profiles and animal quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of domestic animals. Moreover, a collection of interfaces and applications, such as the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST), the Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) and flexible search functionalities, are available to help users effectively explore, analyze and download data related to domestic-animal lncRNAs.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: ALDB enables the exploration and comparative analysis of lncRNAs in domestic animals. A user-friendly web interface, integrated information and tools make it valuable to researchers in their studies. ALDB is freely available from http://res.xaut.edu.cn/aldb/index.jsp.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in multiple fundamental biological processes, such as post-transcriptional gene regulation, and are implicated in many complex human diseases. Mostly ncRNAs function by interacting with corresponding RNA-binding proteins. The research on ncRNA⁻protein interaction is the key to understanding the function of ncRNA. However, the biological experiment techniques for identifying RNA⁻protein interactions (RPIs) are currently still expensive and time-consuming. Due to the complex molecular mechanism of ncRNA⁻protein interaction and the lack of conservation for ncRNA, especially for long ncRNA (lncRNA), the prediction of ncRNA⁻protein interaction is still a challenge. Deep learning-based models have become the state-of-the-art in a range of biological sequence analysis problems due to their strong power of feature learning. In this study, we proposed a hierarchical deep learning framework RPITER to predict RNA⁻protein interaction. For sequence coding, we improved the conjoint triad feature (CTF) coding method by complementing more primary sequence information and adding sequence structure information. For model design, RPITER employed two basic neural network architectures of convolution neural network (CNN) and stacked auto-encoder (SAE). Comprehensive experiments were performed on five benchmark datasets from PDB and NPInter databases to analyze and compare the performances of different sequence coding methods and prediction models. We found that CNN and SAE deep learning architectures have powerful fitting abilities for the k-mer features of RNA and protein sequence. The improved CTF coding method showed performance gain compared with the original CTF method. Moreover, our designed RPITER performed well in predicting RNA⁻protein interaction (RPI) and could outperform most of the previous methods. On five widely used RPI datasets, RPI369, RPI488, RPI1807, RPI2241 and NPInter, RPITER obtained A U C of 0.821, 0.911, 0.990, 0.957 and 0.985, respectively. The proposed RPITER could be a complementary method for predicting RPI and constructing RPI network, which would help push forward the related biological research on ncRNAs and lncRNAs.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The recognition of specific RNA sequences and structures by proteins is critical to our understanding of RNA processing, gene expression and viral replication. The diversity of RNA structures suggests that RNA recognition is substantially different than that of DNA. RESULTS The atomic coordinates of 41 protein-RNA complexes have been used to probe composite nucleoside binding pockets that form the structural and chemical underpinnings of base recognition. Composite nucleoside binding pockets were constructed using three-dimensional superpositions of each RNA nucleoside. Unlike protein-DNA interactions which are dominated by accessibility, RNA recognition frequently occurs in non-canonical and single-strand-like structures that allow interactions to occur from a much wider set of geometries and make fuller use of unique base shapes and hydrogen-bonding ability. By constructing composites that include all van der Waals, hydrogen-bonding, stacking and general non-polar interactions made to a particular nucleoside, the strategies employed are made readily visible. Protein-RNA interactions can result in the formation of a glove-like tight binding pocket around RNA bases, but the size, shape and non-polar binding patterns differ between specific RNA bases. We show that adenine can be distinguished from guanine based on the size and shape of the binding pocket and steric exclusion of the guanine N2 exocyclic amino group. The unique shape and hydrogen-bonding pattern for each RNA base allow proteins to make specific interactions through a very small number of contacts, as few as two in some cases.

We have mapped 388 247 somatic mutations to the experimentally identified miRNA target sites. The updated database also includes a list of somatic mutations in the miRNA seed regions, which contain the most important guiding information for miRNA target recognition. A recently developed webserver, miR2GO, was integrated with the database to provide a seamless pipeline for assessing functional impacts of somatic mutations in miRNA seed regions.

abstract = {The majority of the human transcriptome is defined as non-coding RNA (ncRNA), since only a small fraction of human DNA encodes for proteins, as reported by the ENCODE project. Several distinct classes of ncRNAs, such as transfer RNA, microRNA, and long non-coding RNA, have been classified, each with its own three-dimensional folding and specific function. As ncRNAs are highly abundant in living organisms and have been discovered to play important roles in many biological processes, there has been an ever increasing need to investigate the entire ncRNAome in further unbiased detail. Recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has substantially increased the throughput of transcriptome studies, allowing an unprecedented investigation of ncRNAs, as regulatory pathways and novel functions involving ncRNAs are now also emerging. The huge amount of transcript data produced by NGS has progressively required the development and implementation of suitable bioinformatics workflows, complemented by knowledge-based approaches, to identify, classify, and evaluate the expression of hundreds of ncRNAs in normal and pathological conditions, such as cancer. In this mini-review, we present and discuss current bioinformatics advances in the development of such computational approaches to analyze and classify the ncRNA component of human transcriptome sequence data obtained from NGS technologies.},

To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200×200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70{\%} relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

Increasing evidence from high-throughput sequencing screens also suggests the involvement of lncRNAs in diseases such as cancer, although the underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated.

Considerable evidence indicates that these transcripts act directly as functional RNAs rather than through an encoded protein product. However, a recent study of ribosome occupancy reported that many large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are bound by ribosomes, raising the possibility that they are translated into proteins. Here, we show that classical noncoding RNAs and 5' UTRs show the same ribosome occupancy as lincRNAs, demonstrating that ribosome occupancy alone is not sufficient to classify transcripts as coding or noncoding. Instead, we define a metric based on the known property of translation whereby translating ribosomes are released upon encountering a bona fide stop codon. We show that this metric accurately discriminates between protein-coding transcripts and all classes of known noncoding transcripts, including lincRNAs. Taken together, these results argue that the large majority of lincRNAs do not function through encoded proteins.},

Detecting disease-related microRNAs is helpful for disease therapies. With the development of high throughput experimental techniques, a large number of microRNAs have been sequenced. However, it is still a big challenge to identify which microRNAs are related to diseases. Recently, researchers are interesting in combining multiple-biological information to identify the associations between microRNAs and diseases. In this work, we have proposed a novel method to predict the microRNA-disease associations based on four biological properties. They are microRNA, disease, gene and environment factor. Compared with previous methods, our method makes predictions not only by using the prior knowledge of associations among microRNAs, disease, environment factors and genes, but also by using the internal relationship among these biological properties. We constructed four biological networks based on the similarity of microRNAs, diseases, environment factors and genes, respectively. Then random walking was implemented on the four networks unequally. In the walking course, the associations can be inferred from the neighbors in the same networks. Meanwhile the association information can be transferred from one network to another. The results of experiment showed that our method achieved better prediction performance than other existing state-of-the-art methods.},

A public available webserver for iSeeRNA is also provided for small size dataset. CONCLUSIONS iSeeRNA demonstrates high prediction accuracy and runs several magnitudes faster than other similar programs. It can be integrated into the transcriptome data analysis pipelines or run as a web server, thus offering a valuable tool for lincRNA study.},

abstract = {Cancers arise owing to mutations in a subset of genes that confer growth advantage. The availability of the human genome sequence led us to propose that systematic resequencing of cancer genomes for mutations would lead to the discovery of many additional cancer genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in 274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be 'passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for 'driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes therefore reveals the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a larger repertoire of cancer genes than previously anticipated.},

For example, miRNA-disease association data from genetics, epigenetics, circulating miRNAs and miRNA-target interactions were integrated into the database. In addition, HMDD v2.0 presented more data that were generated based on concepts derived from the miRNA-disease association data, including disease spectrum width of miRNAs and miRNA spectrum width of human diseases. Moreover, we provided users a link to download all the data in the HMDD v2.0 and a link to submit novel data into the database. Meanwhile, we also maintained the old version of HMDD. By keeping data sets up-to-date, HMDD should continue to serve as a valuable resource for investigating the roles of miRNAs in human disease.},

abstract = {PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that guard animal genomes against mutation by silencing transposons. In addition, recent studies have reported that piRNAs silence various endogenous genes. Tens of thousands of distinct piRNAs made in animals do not pair well to transposons and currently the functions and targets of piRNAs are largely unexplored. piRTarBase provides a user-friendly interface to access both predicted and experimentally identified piRNA targeting sites in Caenorhabditis elegans. The user can input genes of interest and retrieve a list of piRNA targeting sites on the input genes. Alternatively, the user can input a piRNA and retrieve a list of its mRNA targets. Additionally, piRTarBase integrates published mRNA and small RNA sequencing data, which will help users identify biologically relevant targeting events. Importantly, our analyses suggest that the piRNA sites found by both predictive and experimental approaches are more likely to exhibit silencing effects on their targets than each method alone. Taken together, piRTarBase offers an integrative platform that will help users to identify functional piRNA target sites by evaluating various information. piRTarBase is freely available for academic use at http://cosbi6.ee.ncku.edu.tw/piRTarBase/.},

They control embryonic gene expression by several means, ranging from microRNA-induced degradation of mRNAs to long ncRNA-mediated modification of chromatin. Many aspects of embryogenesis seem to be controlled by ncRNAs, including the maternal-zygotic transition, the maintenance of pluripotency, the patterning of the body axes, the specification and differentiation of cell types and the morphogenesis of organs. Drawing from several animal model systems, we describe two emerging themes for ncRNA function: promoting developmental transitions and maintaining developmental states. These examples also highlight the roles of ncRNAs in ensuring a robust commitment to one of two possible cell fates.},

We developed a cell-based crosslinking approach to determine at high resolution and transcriptome-wide the binding sites of cellular RBPs and miRNPs. The crosslinked sites are revealed by thymidine to cytidine transitions in the cDNAs prepared from immunopurified RNPs of 4-thiouridine-treated cells. We determined the binding sites and regulatory consequences for several intensely studied RBPs and miRNPs, including PUM2, QKI, IGF2BP1-3, AGO/EIF2C1-4 and TNRC6A-C. Our study revealed that these factors bind thousands of sites containing defined sequence motifs and have distinct preferences for exonic versus intronic or coding versus untranslated transcript regions. The precise mapping of binding sites across the transcriptome will be critical to the interpretation of the rapidly emerging data on genetic variation between individuals and how these variations contribute to complex genetic diseases. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) studies play an important role in the development, invasion, and metastasis of the tumor. The analysis and screening of the differential expression of lncRNAs in cancer and corresponding paracancerous tissues provides new clues for finding new cancer diagnostic indicators and improving the treatment. Predicting lncRNA–protein interactions is very important in the analysis of lncRNAs. This article proposes an Ant-Colony-Clustering-Based Bipartite Network (ACCBN) method and predicts lncRNA–protein interactions. The ACCBN method combines ant colony clustering and bipartite network inference to predict lncRNA–protein interactions. A five-fold cross-validation method was used in the experimental test. The results show that the values of the evaluation indicators of ACCBN on the test set are significantly better after comparing the predictive ability of ACCBN with RWR, ProCF, LPIHN, and LPBNI method. With the continuous development of biology, besides the research on the cellular process, the research on the interaction function between proteins becomes a new key topic of biology. The studies on protein-protein interactions had important implications for bioinformatics, clinical medicine, and pharmacology. However, there are many kinds of proteins, and their functions of interactions are complicated. Moreover, the experimental methods require time to be confirmed because it is difficult to estimate. Therefore, a viable solution is to predict protein-protein interactions efficiently with computers. The ACCBN method has a good effect on the prediction of protein-protein interactions in terms of sensitivity, precision, accuracy, and F1-score.},

abstract = {RNA targets of multitargeted RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) can be studied by various methods including mobility shift assays, iterative in vitro selection techniques and computational approaches. These techniques, however, cannot be used to identify the cellular context within which mRNAs associate, nor can they be used to elucidate the dynamic composition of RNAs in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in response to physiological stimuli. But by combining biochemical and genomics procedures to isolate and identify RNAs associated with RNA-binding proteins, information regarding RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions can be examined more directly within a cellular context. Several protocols--including the yeast three-hybrid system and immunoprecipitations that use physical or chemical cross-linking--have been developed to address this issue. Cross-linking procedures in general, however, are limited by inefficiency and sequence biases. The approach outlined here, termed RNP immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-Chip), allows the identification of discrete subsets of RNAs associated with multi-targeted RNA-binding proteins and provides information regarding changes in the intracellular composition of mRNPs in response to physical, chemical or developmental inducements of living systems. Thus, RIP-Chip can be used to identify subsets of RNAs that have related functions and are potentially co-regulated, as well as proteins that are associated with them in RNP complexes. Using RIP-Chip, the identification and/or quantification of RNAs in RNP complexes can be accomplished within a few hours or days depending on the RNA detection method used.},

Recently molecular interaction data has been used to prioritize candidate genes with respect to a particular disease. As a result, different methods have been implemented to rank genes which cause a given disease. However it has been suggested in literature that, to prioritize candidate genes it is necessary to consider disease similarity along with the protein's proximity to disease genes in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. This paper proposes a new algorithm called proximity disease similarity algorithm (ProSim) which considers both properties simultaneously. Prostate cancer, Alzheimer disease and diabetes mellitus type 2 case studies are then used to test the proposed method.

Currently, protein interactions and associations are annotated at various levels of detail in online resources, ranging from raw data repositories to highly formalized pathway databases. For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms. Here, we describe the update to version 9.1 of STRING, introducing several improvements: (i) we extend the automated mining of scientific texts for interaction information, to now also include full-text articles; (ii) we entirely re-designed the algorithm for transferring interactions from one model organism to the other; and (iii) we provide users with statistical information on any functional enrichment observed in their networks.},

Here, we present an integrative approach to define a reference catalog of {\textgreater}8000 human lincRNAs. Our catalog unifies previously existing annotation sources with transcripts we assembled from RNA-seq data collected from ∼4 billion RNA-seq reads across 24 tissues and cell types. We characterize each lincRNA by a panorama of {\textgreater}30 properties, including sequence, structural, transcriptional, and orthology features. We found that lincRNA expression is strikingly tissue-specific compared with coding genes, and that lincRNAs are typically coexpressed with their neighboring genes, albeit to an extent similar to that of pairs of neighboring protein-coding genes. We distinguish an additional subset of transcripts that have high evolutionary conservation but may include short ORFs and may serve as either lincRNAs or small peptides. Our integrated, comprehensive, yet conservative reference catalog of human lincRNAs reveals the global properties of lincRNAs and will facilitate experimental studies and further functional classification of these genes.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs have close relationship with human diseases. Therefore, identifying disease related MicroRNAs plays an important role in disease diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. However, designing an effective computational method which can make good use of various biological resources and correctly predict the associations between MicroRNA and disease is still a big challenge. Previous researchers have pointed out that there are complex relationships among microRNAs, diseases and environment factors. There are inter-relationships between microRNAs, diseases or environment factors based on their functional similarity or phenotype similarity or chemical structure similarity and so on. There are also intra-relationships between microRNAs and diseases, microRNAs and environment factors, diseases and environment factors. Moreover, functionally similar microRNAs tend to associate with common diseases and common environment factors. The diseases with similar phenotypes are likely caused by common microRNAs and common environment factors. In this work, we propose a framework namely ThrRWMDE which can integrate these complex relationships to predict microRNAdisease associations. In this framework, microRNA similarity network( MFN), disease similarity network(DSN) and environmental factor similarity network(ESN) are constructed according to certain biological properties. Then, an unbalanced three random walking algorithm is implemented on the three networks so as to obtain information from neighbors in corresponding networks. This algorithm not only can flexibly infer information from different levels of neighbors with respect to the topological and structural differences of the three networks, but also in the course of working the functional information will be transferred from one network to another according to the associations between the nodes in different networks. The results of experiment show that our method achieves better prediction performance than other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Knowing the sequence specificities of DNA- and RNA-binding proteins is essential for developing models of the regulatory processes in biological systems and for identifying causal disease variants. Here we show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental data with 'deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment. Specificities determined by DeepBind are readily visualized as a weighted ensemble of position weight matrices or as a 'mutation map' that indicates how variations affect binding within a specific sequence.},

The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription, transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification. These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80{\%} of the genome, in particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation. The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional annotations for biomedical research},

abstract = {There is more and more evidence that the mutation and dysregulation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are associated with numerous diseases, including cancers. However, experimental methods to identify associations between lncRNAs and diseases are expensive and time-consuming. Effective computational approaches to identify disease-related lncRNAs are in high demand; and would benefit the detection of lncRNA biomarkers for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In light of some limitations of existing computational methods, we developed a global network random walk model for predicting lncRNA-disease associations (GrwLDA) to reveal the potential associations between lncRNAs and diseases. GrwLDA is a universal network-based method and does not require negative samples. This method can be applied to a disease with no known associated lncRNA (isolated disease) and to lncRNA with no known associated disease (novel lncRNA). The leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) method was implemented to evaluate the predicted performance of GrwLDA. As a result, GrwLDA obtained reliable AUCs of 0.9449, 0.8562, and 0.8374 for overall, novel lncRNA and isolated disease prediction, respectively, significantly outperforming previous methods. Case studies of colon, gastric, and kidney cancers were also implemented, and the top 5 disease-lncRNA associations were reported for each disease. Interestingly, 13 (out of the 15) associations were confirmed by literature mining.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Noncoding RNA species play a diverse set of roles in the eukaryotic cell. While much recent attention has focused on smaller RNA species, larger noncoding transcripts are also thought to be highly abundant in mammalian cells. To search for large noncoding RNAs that might control gene expression or mRNA metabolism, we used Affymetrix expression arrays to identify polyadenylated RNA transcripts displaying nuclear enrichment. RESULTS This screen identified no more than three transcripts; XIST, and two unique noncoding nuclear enriched abundant transcripts (NEAT) RNAs strikingly located less than 70 kb apart on human chromosome 11: NEAT1, a noncoding RNA from the locus encoding for TncRNA, and NEAT2 (also known as MALAT-1). While the two NEAT transcripts share no significant homology with each other, each is conserved within the mammalian lineage, suggesting significant function for these noncoding RNAs. NEAT2 is extraordinarily well conserved for a noncoding RNA, more so than even XIST. Bioinformatic analyses of publicly available mouse transcriptome data support our findings from human cells as they confirm that the murine homologs of these noncoding RNAs are also nuclear enriched. RNA FISH analyses suggest that these noncoding RNAs function in mRNA metabolism as they demonstrate an intimate association of these RNA species with SC35 nuclear speckles in both human and mouse cells. These studies show that one of these transcripts, NEAT1 localizes to the periphery of such domains, whereas the neighboring transcript, NEAT2, is part of the long-sought polyadenylated component of nuclear speckles. CONCLUSION Our genome-wide screens in two mammalian species reveal no more than three abundant large non-coding polyadenylated RNAs in the nucleus; the canonical large noncoding RNA XIST and NEAT1 and NEAT2. The function of these noncoding RNAs in mRNA metabolism is suggested by their high levels of conservation and their intimate association with SC35 splicing domains in multiple mammalian species.},

abstract = {LncRNAs play pivotal roles in many important biological processes, but research on the functions of lncRNAs in human disease is still in its infancy. Therefore, it is urgent to prioritize lncRNAs that are potentially associated with diseases. In this work, we developed a novel algorithm, LncPriCNet, that uses a multi-level composite network to prioritize candidate lncRNAs associated with diseases. By integrating genes, lncRNAs, phenotypes and their associations, LncPriCNet achieves an overall performance superior to that of previous methods, with high AUC values of up to 0.93. Notably, LncPriCNet still performs well when information on known disease lncRNAs is lacking. When applied to breast cancer, LncPriCNet identified known breast cancer-related lncRNAs, revealed novel lncRNA candidates and inferred their functions via pathway analysis. We further constructed the human disease-lncRNA landscape, revealed the modularity of the disease-lncRNA network and identified several lncRNA hotspots. In summary, LncPriCNet is a useful tool for prioritizing disease-related lncRNAs and may facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of human disease at the lncRNA level.},

abstract = {In mammals, thousands of long non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) ({\textgreater}200 nt) have recently been described. However, the biological significance and function of the vast majority of these transcripts remain unclear. We have constructed a public repository, the Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED), which provides gene expression information for thousands of long ncRNAs in human and mouse. The database contains both microarray and in situ hybridization data, much of which is described here for the first time. NRED also supplies a rich tapestry of ancillary information for featured ncRNAs, including evolutionary conservation, secondary structure evidence, genomic context links and antisense relationships. The database is available at http://jsm-research.imb.uq.edu.au/NRED, and the web interface enables both advanced searches and data downloads. Taken together, NRED should significantly advance the study and understanding of long ncRNAs, and provides a timely and valuable resource to the scientific community.},

Previous versions of DrugBank have been widely used to facilitate drug and in silico drug target discovery. The latest update, DrugBank 4.0, has been further expanded to contain data on drug metabolism, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) and other kinds of quantitative structure activity relationships (QSAR) information. These enhancements are intended to facilitate research in xenobiotic metabolism (both prediction and characterization), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and drug design/discovery. For this release, {\textgreater}1200 drug metabolites (including their structures, names, activity, abundance and other detailed data) have been added along with {\textgreater}1300 drug metabolism reactions (including metabolizing enzymes and reaction types) and dozens of drug metabolism pathways. Another 30 predicted or measured ADMET parameters have been added to each DrugCard, bringing the average number of quantitative ADMET values for Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs close to 40. Referential nuclear magnetic resonance and MS spectra have been added for almost 400 drugs as well as spectral and mass matching tools to facilitate compound identification. This expanded collection of drug information is complemented by a number of new or improved search tools, including one that provides a simple analyses of drug-target, -enzyme and -transporter associations to provide insight on drug-drug interactions.},

Computational methods are needed to combine these data to create a comprehensive view of a given disease or a biological process. Similarity network fusion (SNF) solves this problem by constructing networks of samples (e.g., patients) for each available data type and then efficiently fusing these into one network that represents the full spectrum of underlying data. For example, to create a comprehensive view of a disease given a cohort of patients, SNF computes and fuses patient similarity networks obtained from each of their data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity in the data. We used SNF to combine mRNA expression, DNA methylation and microRNA (miRNA) expression data for five cancer data sets. SNF substantially outperforms single data type analysis and established integrative approaches when identifying cancer subtypes and is effective for predicting survival.},

abstract = {Massive studies have indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for the regulation of cellular biological processes by binding with RNA-related proteins. However, only a few experimentally supported lncRNA-protein associations have been reported. Existing network-based methods are typically focused on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological networks associated with lncRNAs. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we propose PLPIHS, an effective computational method for Predicting lncRNA-Protein Interactions using HeteSim Scores. PLPIHS uses the HeteSim measure to calculate the relatedness score for each lncRNA-protein pair in the heterogeneous network, which consists of lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein association network and protein-protein interaction network. An SVM classifier to predict lncRNA-protein interactions is built with the HeteSim scores. The results show that PLPIHS performs significantly better than the existing state-of-the-art approaches and achieves an AUC score of 0.97 in the leave-one-out validation test. We also compare the performances of networks with different connectivity density and find that PLPIHS performs well across all the networks. Furthermore, we use the proposed method to identify the related proteins for lncRNA MALAT1. Highly-ranked proteins are verified by the biological studies and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {Central nervous system (CNS) development, homeostasis, stress responses, and plasticity are all mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that modulate gene expression and promote selective deployment of functional gene networks in response to complex profiles of interoceptive and environmental signals. Thus, not surprisingly, disruptions of these epigenetic processes are implicated in the pathogenesis of a spectrum of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Epigenetic mechanisms involve chromatin remodeling by relatively generic complexes that catalyze DNA methylation and various types of histone modifications. There is increasing evidence that these complexes are directed to their sites of action by long non-protein-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), of which there are tens if not hundreds of thousands specified in the genome. LncRNAs are transcribed in complex intergenic, overlapping and antisense patterns relative to adjacent protein-coding genes, suggesting that many lncRNAs regulate the expression of these genes. LncRNAs also participate in a wide array of subcellular processes, including the formation and function of cellular organelles. Most lncRNAs are transcribed in a developmentally regulated and cell type specific manner, particularly in the CNS, wherein over half of all lncRNAs are expressed. While the numerous biological functions of lncRNAs are yet to be characterized fully, a number of recent studies suggest that lnRNAs are important for mediating cell identity. This function seems to be especially important for generating the enormous array of regional neuronal and glial cell subtypes that are present in the CNS. Further studies have also begun to elucidate additional roles played by lncRNAs in CNS processes, including homeostasis, stress responses and plasticity. Herein, we review emerging evidence that highlights the expression and function of lncRNAs in the CNS and suggests that lncRNA deregulation is an important factor in various CNS pathologies including neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative and neuroimmunological disorders, primary brain tumors, and psychiatric diseases. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we constructed a series of vectors to test how two protein products were translated from a single transcript in vitro. The length of the ORF (open reading frame), position of the first AUG and the Kozak motif were found to be important factors. These factors, as well as 55-bp NMD (nonsense-mediated mRNA decay) rule, were used in a bioinformatics search for candidate dual-coding transcripts. A total of 1307, 750 and 474 two-ORF-containing transcripts were found in human, mouse and rat, respectively, of which 170, 89 and 70, respectively, were found to be potential dual-coding transcripts. Most transcripts showed low conservation among species.

abstract = {Accumulating evidences have indicated that lncRNAs play an important role in various human complex diseases. However, known disease-related lncRNAs are still comparatively small in number, and experimental identification is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, developing a useful computational method for inferring potential associations between lncRNAs and diseases has become a hot topic, which can significantly help people to explore complex human diseases at the molecular level and effectively advance the quality of disease diagnostics, therapy, prognosis and prevention. In this paper, we propose a novel prediction of lncRNA-disease associations via lncRNA-disease-gene tripartite graph (TPGLDA), which integrates gene-disease associations with lncRNA-disease associations. Compared to previous studies, TPGLDA can be used to better delineate the heterogeneity of coding-non-coding genes-disease association and can effectively identify potential lncRNA-disease associations. After implementing the leave-one-out cross validation, TPGLDA achieves an AUC value of 93.9{\%} which demonstrates its good predictive performance. Moreover, the top 5 predicted rankings of lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer are manually confirmed by different relevant databases and literatures, affording convincing evidence of the good performance as well as potential value of TPGLDA in identifying potential lncRNA-disease associations.

abstract = {Programs for RNA mutational analysis that are structure-based and rely on secondary structure prediction have been developed and expanded in the past several years. They can be used for a variety of purposes, such as in suggesting point mutations that will alter RNA virus replication or translation initiation, investigating the effect of deleterious and compensatory mutations in allosteric ribozymes and riboswitches, computing an optimal path of mutations to get from one ribozyme fold to another, or analyzing regulatory RNA sequences by their mutational profile. This review describes three different freeware programs (RNAMute, RDMAS and RNAmutants) that have been developed for such purposes. RNAMute and RDMAS in principle perform energy minimization prediction by available software such as RNAfold from the Vienna RNA package or Zuker's Mfold, while RNAmutants provides an efficient method using essential ingredients from energy minimization prediction. Both RNAMute in its extended version that uses RNAsubopt from the Vienna RNA package and the RNAmutants software are able to predict multiple-point mutations using developed methodologies, while RDMAS is currently restricted to single-point mutations. The strength of RNAMute in its extended version is the ability to predict a small number of point mutations in an accurate manner. RNAmutants is well fit for large scale simulations involving the calculation of all k-mutants, where k can be a large integer number, of a given RNA sequence.},

In contrast to protein coding genes, genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are often poorly or inconsistently annotated. This makes comparative studies based on rRNA genes difficult. We have therefore created computational predictors for the major rRNA species from all kingdoms of life and compiled them into a program called RNAmmer. The program uses hidden Markov models trained on data from the 5S ribosomal RNA database and the European ribosomal RNA database project. A pre-screening step makes the method fast with little loss of sensitivity, enabling the analysis of a complete bacterial genome in less than a minute. Results from running RNAmmer on a large set of genomes indicate that the location of rRNAs can be predicted with a very high level of accuracy. Novel, unannotated rRNAs are also predicted in many genomes. The software as well as the genome analysis results are available at the CBS web server.},

Similar to protein-coding genes, their expression is also controlled by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Disruption of these control processes leads to abnormal expression of miRNAs in cancer. In this chapter, we discuss the supportive links between miRNAs and epigenetics in the context of carcinogenesis. miRNAs can be epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and/or specific histone modifications. However, they can themselves (epi-miRNAs) repress key enzymes that drive epigenetic remodeling and also bind to complementary sequences in gene promoters, recruiting specific protein complexes that modulate chromatin structure and gene expression. All these issues affect the transcriptional landscape of cells. Most important, in the cancer clinical scenario, knowledge about miRNAs epigenetic dysregulation can not only be beneficial as a prognostic biomarker, but can also help in the design of new therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {The complete sequence of the 16,295 bp mouse L cell mitochondrial DNA genome has been determined. Genes for the 12S and 16S ribosomal RNAs; 22 tRNAs; cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II and III; ATPase subunit 6; cytochrome b; and eight unidentified proteins have been located. The genome displays exceptional economy of organization, with tRNA genes interspersed between rRNA and protein-coding genes with zero or few noncoding nucleotides between coding sequences. Only two significant portions of the genome, the 879 nucleotide displacement-loop region containing the origin of heavy-strand replication and the 32 nucleotide origin of light-strand replication, do not encode a functional RNA species. All of the remaining nucleotide sequence serves as a defined coding function, with the exception of 32 nucleotides, of which 18 occur at the 5' ends of open reading frames. Mouse mitochondrial DNA is unique in that the translational start codon is AUN, with any of the four nucleotides in the third position, whereas the only translational stop codon is the orthodox UAA. The mouse mitochondrial DNA genome is highly homologous in overall sequence and in gene organization to human mitochondrial DNA, with the descending order of conserved regions being tRNA genes; origin of light-strand replication; rRNA genes; known protein-coding genes; unidentified protein-coding genes; displacement-loop region.},

The creation of GeneRIF entries involves the identification of the genes mentioned in MEDLINE{\textregistered}; citations and the sentences describing a novel function.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: We have compared several learning algorithms and several features extracted or derived from MEDLINE sentences to determine if a sentence should be selected for GeneRIF indexing. Features are derived from the sentences or using mechanisms to augment the information provided by them: assigning a discourse label using a previously trained model, for example. We show that machine learning approaches with specific feature combinations achieve results close to one of the annotators. We have evaluated different feature sets and learning algorithms. In particular, Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes achieves better performance with a selection of features similar to one used in related work, which considers the location of the sentence, the discourse of the sentence and the functional terminology in it.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: The current performance is at a level similar to human annotation and it shows that machine learning can be used to automate the task of sentence selection for GeneRIF annotation.

abstract = {BACKGROUND The GENCODE project has collected over 10,000 human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes. However, the vast majority of them remain to be functionally characterized. Computational investigation of potential functions of human lncRNA genes is helpful to guide further experimental studies on lncRNAs. RESULTS In this study, based on expression correlation between lncRNAs and protein-coding genes across 19 human normal tissues, we used the hypergeometric test to functionally annotate a single lncRNA or a set of lncRNAs with significantly enriched functional terms among the protein-coding genes that are significantly co-expressed with the lncRNA(s). The functional terms include all nodes in the Gene Ontology (GO) and 4,380 human biological pathways collected from 12 pathway databases. We successfully mapped 9,625 human lncRNA genes to GO terms and biological pathways, and then developed the first ontology-driven user-friendly web interface named lncRNA2Function, which enables researchers to browse the lncRNAs associated with a specific functional term, the functional terms associated with a specific lncRNA, or to assign functional terms to a set of human lncRNA genes, such as a cluster of co-expressed lncRNAs. The lncRNA2Function is freely available at http://mlg.hit.edu.cn/lncrna2function. CONCLUSIONS The LncRNA2Function is an important resource for further investigating the functions of a single human lncRNA, or functionally annotating a set of human lncRNAs of interest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Current technology has demonstrated that mutation and deregulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are associated with diverse human diseases and important biological processes. Therefore, developing a novel computational method for predicting potential ncRNA-disease associations could benefit pathologists in understanding the correlation between ncRNAs and disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. However, only a few studies have investigated these associations in pathogenesis. RESULTS This study utilizes a disease-target-ncRNA tripartite network, and computes prediction scores between each disease-ncRNA pair by integrating biological information derived from pairwise similarity based upon sequence expressions with weights obtained from a multi-layer resource allocation technique. Our proposed algorithm was evaluated based on a 5-fold-cross-validation with optimal kernel parameter tuning. In addition, we achieved an average AUC that varies from 0.75 without link cut to 0.57 with link cut methods, which outperforms a previous method using the same evaluation methodology. Furthermore, the algorithm predicted 23 ncRNA-disease associations supported by other independent biological experimental studies. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these results demonstrate the capability and accuracy of predicting further biological significant associations between ncRNAs and diseases and highlight the importance of adding biological sequence information to enhance predictions.},

abstract = {Similarity search is an important function in many applications, which usually focuses on measuring the similarity between objects with the same type. However, in many scenarios, we need to measure the relatedness between objects with different types. With the surge of study on heterogeneous networks, the relevance measure on objects with different types becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we study the relevance search problem in heterogeneous networks, where the task is to measure the relatedness of heterogeneous objects (including objects with the same type or different types). A novel measure HeteSim is proposed, which has the following attributes: (1) a uniform measure: it can measure the relatedness of objects with the same or different types in a uniform framework; (2) a path-constrained measure: the relatedness of object pairs are defined based on the search path that connect two objects through following a sequence of node types; (3) a semi-metric measure: HeteSim has some good properties (e.g., self-maximum and symmetric), that are crucial to many data mining tasks. Moreover, we analyze the computation characteristics of HeteSim and propose the corresponding quick computation strategies. Empirical studies show that HeteSim can effectively and efficiently evaluate the relatedness of heterogeneous objects.},

abstract = {Drug-target interaction (DTI) is the basis of drug discovery and design. It is time consuming and costly to determine DTI experimentally. Hence, it is necessary to develop computational methods for the prediction of potential DTI. Based on complex network theory, three supervised inference methods were developed here to predict DTI and used for drug repositioning, namely drug-based similarity inference (DBSI), target-based similarity inference (TBSI) and network-based inference (NBI). Among them, NBI performed best on four benchmark data sets. Then a drug-target network was created with NBI based on 12,483 FDA-approved and experimental drug-target binary links, and some new DTIs were further predicted. In vitro assays confirmed that five old drugs, namely montelukast, diclofenac, simvastatin, ketoconazole, and itraconazole, showed polypharmacological features on estrogen receptors or dipeptidyl peptidase-IV with half maximal inhibitory or effective concentration ranged from 0.2 to 10 µM. Moreover, simvastatin and ketoconazole showed potent antiproliferative activities on human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line in MTT assays. The results indicated that these methods could be powerful tools in prediction of DTIs and drug repositioning.},

PARTICLE affords both a cytosolic scaffold for the tumor suppressor methionine adenosyltransferase (. MAT2A) and a nuclear genetic platform for transcriptional repression. In situ hybridization discloses that PARTICLE and MAT2A associate together following irradiation. Bromouridine tracing and presence in exosomes indicate intercellular transport, and this is supported by exvivo data from radiotherapy-treated patients. Surface plasmon resonance indicates that PARTICLE forms a DNA-lncRNA triplex upstream of a MAT2A promoter CpG island. We show that PARTICLE represses MAT2A via methylation and demonstrate that the radiation-induced PARTICLE interacts withthe transcription-repressive complex proteins G9a and SUZ12 (subunit of PRC2). The interplay of PARTICLE with MAT2A implicates this lncRNA in intercellular communication and as a recruitment platform for gene-silencing machineries through triplex formation in response to irradiation.},

Therefore, for the convenience of the researchers, we collected regulatory relationships of the lncRNAs and built a database called 'LncReg'.

However, the complement of human genes in which introns are transcribed, and the number of intronic transcriptional units and their tissue expression patterns are not known.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: A survey of mRNA and EST public databases revealed more than 55,000 totally intronic noncoding (TIN) RNAs transcribed from the introns of 74{\%} of all unique RefSeq genes. Guided by this information, we designed an oligoarray platform containing sense and antisense probes for each of 7,135 randomly selected TIN transcripts plus the corresponding protein-coding genes. We identified exonic and intronic tissue-specific expression signatures for human liver, prostate and kidney. The most highly expressed antisense TIN RNAs were transcribed from introns of protein-coding genes significantly enriched (p = 0.002 to 0.022) in the 'Regulation of transcription' Gene Ontology category. RNA polymerase II inhibition resulted in increased expression of a fraction of intronic RNAs in cell cultures, suggesting that other RNA polymerases may be involved in their biosynthesis. Members of a subset of intronic and protein-coding signatures transcribed from the same genomic loci have correlated expression patterns, suggesting that intronic RNAs regulate the abundance or the pattern of exon usage in protein-coding messages.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSION: We have identified diverse intronic RNA expression patterns, pointing to distinct regulatory roles.

abstract = {Recent genomic studies suggest that novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are specifically expressed and far outnumber annotated lncRNA sequences. To identify and characterize novel lncRNAs in RNA sequencing data from new samples, we have developed COME, a coding potential calculation tool based on multiple features. It integrates multiple sequence-derived and experiment-based features using a decompose-compose method, which makes it more accurate and robust than other well-known tools. We also showed that COME was able to substantially improve the consistency of predication results from other coding potential calculators. Moreover, COME annotates and characterizes each predicted lncRNA transcript with multiple lines of supporting evidence, which are not provided by other tools. Remarkably, we found that one subgroup of lncRNAs classified by such supporting features (i.e. conserved local RNA secondary structure) was highly enriched in a well-validated database (lncRNAdb). We further found that the conserved structural domains on lncRNAs had better chance than other RNA regions to interact with RNA binding proteins, based on the recent eCLIP-seq data in human, indicating their potential regulatory roles. Overall, we present COME as an accurate, robust and multiple-feature supported method for the identification and characterization of novel lncRNAs. The software implementation is available at https://github.com/lulab/COME.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in many biological processes. Predicting the miRNA-disease associations will aid in deciphering the underlying pathogenesis of human polygenic diseases. However, existing in silico prediction methods typically utilize a single or limited data sources for disease-related miRNA prioritization and most of the methods are biased toward known miRNA-disease associations. Due to the insufficient number of experimentally validated interactions as well as no experimentally verified negative samples, obtaining remarkable performances is still challenging for these methods. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised method of Kronecker regularized least squares for predicting the potential or missing miRNA-disease associations (KRLSM). KRLSM integrates different omics data to assist various diseases or miRNAs with sparsely known associations to make predictions, and combines the disease space and miRNA space into a whole miRNA-disease space by Kronecker product. Finally, the semi-supervised classifier of regularized least squares is adopted to identify disease-related miRNAs. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the other state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, case studies of several common diseases further indicate the effectiveness of KRLSM to identify potential miRNA-disease associations.},

We develop a new algorithm, MM-align, for sequence-independent alignment of protein complex structures. The algorithm is built on a heuristic iteration of a modified Needleman-Wunsch dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, with the alignment score specified by the inter-complex residue distances. The multiple chains in each complex are first joined, in every possible order, and then simultaneously aligned with cross-chain alignments prevented. The alignments of interface residues are enhanced by an interface-specific weighting factor. MM-align is tested on a large-scale benchmark set of 205 x 3897 non-homologous multiple-chain complex pairs. Compared with a na{\"{i}}ve extension of the monomer alignment program of TM-align, the alignment accuracy of MM-align is significantly higher as judged by the average TM-score of the physically-aligned residues. MM-align is about two times faster than TM-align because of omitting the cross-alignment zone of the DP matrix. It also shows that the enhanced alignment of the interfaces helps in identifying biologically relevant protein complex pairs.},

Mutations and dysfunction of lncRNAs have been implicated in human disorders. Many lncRNAs exert their effects through interactions with the corresponding RNA-binding proteins. Several computational approaches have been developed, but only few are able to perform the prediction of these interactions from a network-based point of view. Here, we introduce a computational method named lncRNA-protein bipartite network inference (LPBNI). LPBNI aims to identify potential lncRNA-interacting proteins, by making full use of the known lncRNA-protein interactions. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) test shows that LPBNI significantly outperforms other network-based methods, including random walk (RWR) and protein-based collaborative filtering (ProCF). Furthermore, a case study was performed to demonstrate the performance of LPBNI using real data in predicting potential lncRNA-interacting proteins.},

abstract = {RIKEN's FANTOM project has revealed many previously unknown coding sequences, as well as an unexpected degree of variation in transcripts resulting from alternative promoter usage and splicing. Ever more transcripts that do not code for proteins have been identified by transcriptome studies, in general. Increasing evidence points to the important cellular roles of such non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). The distinction of protein-coding RNA transcripts from ncRNA transcripts is therefore an important problem in understanding the transcriptome and carrying out its annotation. Very few in silico methods have specifically addressed this problem. Here, we introduce CONC (for "coding or non-coding"), a novel method based on support vector machines that classifies transcripts according to features they would have if they were coding for proteins. These features include peptide length, amino acid composition, predicted secondary structure content, predicted percentage of exposed residues, compositional entropy, number of homologs from database searches, and alignment entropy. Nucleotide frequencies are also incorporated into the method. Confirmed coding cDNAs for eukaryotic proteins from the Swiss-Prot database constituted the set of true positives, ncRNAs from RNAdb and NONCODE the true negatives. Ten-fold cross-validation suggested that CONC distinguished coding RNAs from ncRNAs at about 97{\%} specificity and 98{\%} sensitivity. Applied to 102,801 mouse cDNAs from the FANTOM3 dataset, our method reliably identified over 14,000 ncRNAs and estimated the total number of ncRNAs to be about 28,000.},

The antisense noncoding RNA ANRIL of the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus is also important for expression of the protein-coding genes in cis, but its mechanism has remained elusive. Here we report that chromobox 7 (CBX7) within the polycomb repressive complex 1 binds to ANRIL, and both CBX7 and ANRIL are found at elevated levels in prostate cancer tissues. In concert with H3K27me recognition, binding to RNA contributes to CBX7 function, and disruption of either interaction impacts the ability of CBX7 to repress the INK4b/ARF/INK4a locus and control senescence. Structure-guided analysis reveals the molecular interplay between noncoding RNA and H3K27me as mediated by the conserved chromodomain.

The growing corpus of literature in the field provides ample evidence to suggest the important role of lncRNAs as regulators in a wide spectrum of biological processes. Recent evidence also suggests the role of lncRNAs in the pathophysiology of disease processes. AREAS COVERED The authors discuss a conceptual framework for understanding lncRNA-mediated regulation as a function of its interaction with other biomolecules in the cell. They summarize the mechanisms of the known functions of lncRNAs in light of this conceptual framework, and suggest how this insight could help in discovering novel targets for drug discovery. They also argue how certain emerging technologies could be of immense utility, both in discovering potential therapeutic targets as well as in further therapeutic development. EXPERT OPINION The authors propose how the field could immensely benefit from methodologies and technologies from six emerging fields in molecular and computational biology. They also suggest a futuristic area of lncRNAs design as a potential offshoot of synthetic biology, which would be an attractive field, both for discovery of targets as well as a therapeutic strategy.},

Recent studies have implicated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cALL etiology, progression, and treatment response. However, barring some exceptions little is known about the functional impact of lncRNAs on cancer biology, which limits their potential as potential therapeutic targets. We wanted to investigate the functional role of lncRNAs identified as specifically overexpressed in pre-B cALL by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Here we report five lncRNAs specifically upregulated in pre-B cALL that had significant impacts on cancer hallmark traits such as cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and treatment response. In particular, silencing of the RP11-137H2.4 lncRNA effectively restored normal glucocorticoid (GC) response in a GC-resistant pre-B cALL cell line and specifically modulated expression of members of both the NRAS/BRAF/NF-{\$}\kappa{\$}B MAPK cascade and cell cycle pathways. Since GC form the cornerstone of cALL chemotherapy and resistance in cALL confers a dismal prognosis, characterizing RP11-137H2.4'sexact role and function in this process will be critical to the development of new therapeutic approaches to overcome GC resistance in children treated for cALL.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic variants contributing to the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) at the chromosome 9p21 locus. The CVD-associated region is adjacent to the two cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKN)2A and 2B and the last exons of the non-coding RNA, ANRIL. It is still not clear which of or how these transcripts are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE We assessed the hypothesis that 9p21 locus polymorphisms influence the expression of the transcripts in the region (ANRIL, CDKN2A/B) and that these transcripts contribute to atherogenesis through the modulation of proliferation in VSMC. METHODS We genotyped 18 SNPs (r(2){\textless}0.8 and MAF{\textgreater}0.05) across the region of interest: CDKN2A/B and ANRIL, encompassing the CVD-associated region. RNA and DNA were extracted from the blood of 57 volunteers (69-72 years old). Carotid ultrasound was performed in 56 subjects. CDKN2A/B and ANRIL (exons 1-2 and 17-18) expression was measured employing RT-PCR. Gene expression and cell growth were evaluated in cultured VSMC after the siRNA-mediated knock-down of ANRIL. RESULTS The risk alleles for atherosclerosis-related phenotypes were consistently associated with a lower expression of ANRIL when evaluating exons 1-2. Common carotid artery stenosis was associated with a significantly lower (P{\textless}0.01) expression of ANRIL (exons 1-2). ANRIL knock-down in VSMC caused significant variation in expression of CDKN2A/B (P{\textless}0.05) and reduction of cell growth (P{\textless}0.05) in vitro. CONCLUSION Disease-associated SNPs at the 9p21 locus predominantly affect the expression of ANRIL. Overall, our results suggest that several CVD-associated SNPs in the 9p21 locus affect the expression of ANRIL, which, in turn modulate cell growth, possibly via CDKN2A/B regulation.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are a large and diverse group of transcripts that span the eukaryotic genome, of which less than 2{\%} encodes proteins. Several distinct families of ncRNAs have been described and implicated in many aspects of central nervous system (CNS) function including translation, RNA metabolism, gene regulation, and development. The need to distinguish ncRNAs from sequence data, as well as potentially uncovering novel ncRNA families, has ignited the development of customized computational approaches and bioinformatic resources to handle these tasks. In this review, we provide an overview of the numerous procedures developed to predict ncRNAs based on their primary sequence and predicted secondary structure. These methodologies are broadly grouped into genome scanning algorithms, mixed approaches, and machine learning algorithms. Regulatory ncRNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), are a major focus of current research efforts and this review will therefore center on the prediction of miRNAs and the putative gene targets they act upon. With the advent of ultra high-throughput sequencing technologies 'deep sequencing' has emerged as the cutting-edge method for ncRNA identification and we will also touch on some computational resources that play a key role in analysis of this type of data.},

abstract = {Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel, increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and associated protein-coding genes, as well as terms contained in the annotations, such as the tissues in which the transcripts are expressed and associated diseases. In addition, lncRNAdb is linked to the UCSC Genome Browser for visualization and Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) for expression information from a variety of sources. lncRNAdb provides a platform for the ongoing collation of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs and their association with other genomic elements. lncRNAdb can be accessed at: http://www.lncrnadb.org/.},

abstract = {This paper studies the problem of embedding very large information networks into low-dimensional vector spaces, which is useful in many tasks such as visualization, node classification, and link prediction. Most existing graph embedding methods do not scale for real world information networks which usually contain millions of nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel network embedding method called the "LINE," which is suitable for arbitrary types of information networks: undirected, directed, and/or weighted. The method optimizes a carefully designed objective function that preserves both the local and global network structures. An edge-sampling algorithm is proposed that addresses the limitation of the classical stochastic gradient descent and improves both the effectiveness and the efficiency of the inference. Empirical experiments prove the effectiveness of the LINE on a variety of real-world information networks, including language networks, social networks, and citation networks. The algorithm is very efficient, which is able to learn the embedding of a network with millions of vertices and billions of edges in a few hours on a typical single machine. The source code of the LINE is available online.},

abstract = {Accumulating experimental studies have indicated the influence of lncRNAs on various critical biological processes as well as disease development and progression. Calculating lncRNA functional similarity is of high value in inferring lncRNA functions and identifying potential lncRNA-disease associations. However, little effort has been attempt to measure the functional similarity among lncRNAs on a large scale. In this study, we developed a Fuzzy Measure-based LNCRNA functional SIMilarity calculation model (FMLNCSIM) based on the assumption that functionally similar lncRNAs tend to be associated with similar diseases. The performance improvement of FMLNCSIM mainly comes from the combination of information content and the concept of fuzzy measure, which was applied to the directed acyclic graphs of disease MeSH descriptors. To evaluate the effectiveness of FMLNCSIM, we further combined it with the previously proposed model of Laplacian Regularized Least Squares for lncRNA-Disease Association (LRLSLDA). As a result, the integrated model, LRLSLDA-FMLNCSIM, achieve good performance in the frameworks of global LOOCV (AUCs of 0.8266 and 0.9338 based on LncRNADisease and MNDR database) and 5-fold cross validation (average AUCs of 0.7979 and 0.9237 based on LncRNADisease and MNDR database), which significantly improve the performance of previous classical models. It is anticipated that FMLNCSIM could be used for searching functionally similar lncRNAs and inferring lncRNA functions in the future researches.},

Combining these two technologies, we have created a comprehensive and accurate genome-wide open chromatin map. Surprisingly, only 16{\%}-21{\%} of the identified 94,925 DNase I HS sites are found in promoters or first exons of known genes, but nearly half of the most open sites are in these regions.

abstract = {Essential proteins are vital for an organism's viability under a variety of conditions. There are many experimental and computational methods developed to identify essential proteins. Computational prediction of essential proteins based on the global protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is severely restricted because of the insufficiency of the PPI data, but fortunately the gene expression profiles help to make up the deficiency. In this work, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used to bridge the gap between PPI and gene expression data. Based on PCC and edge clustering coefficient (ECC), a new centrality measure, i.e., the weighted degree centrality (WDC), is developed to achieve the reliable prediction of essential proteins.WDCis employed to identify essential proteins in the yeast PPI and e-Coli networks in order to estimate its performance. For comparison, other prediction technologies are also performed to identify essential proteins. Some evaluation methods are used to analyze the results from various prediction approaches. The prediction results and comparative analyses are shown in the paper. Furthermore, the parameter ? in the methodWDCwill be analyzed in detail and an optimal ? value will be found. Based on the optimal ? value, the differentiation ofWDC and another prediction method PeC is discussed. The analyses prove thatWDCoutperforms other methods including DC, BC, CC, SC, EC, IC, NC, and PeC. At the same time, the analyses also mean that it is an effective way to predict essential proteins by means of integrating different data sources.},

abstract = {Transcript degradation is a widespread and important mechanism for regulating protein abundance. Two major regulators of transcript degradation are RNA Binding Proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs). We computationally explored whether RBPs and miRNAs cooperate to promote transcript decay. We defined five RBP motifs based on the evolutionary conservation of their recognition sites in 3'UTRs as the binding motifs for Pumilio (PUM), U1A, Fox-1, Nova, and UAUUUAU. Recognition sites for some of these RBPs tended to localize at the end of long 3'UTRs. A specific group of miRNA recognition sites were enriched within 50 nts from the RBP recognition sites for PUM and UAUUUAU. The presence of both a PUM recognition site and a recognition site for preferentially co-occurring miRNAs was associated with faster decay of the associated transcripts. For PUM and its co-occurring miRNAs, binding of the RBP to its recognition sites was predicted to release nearby miRNA recognition sites from RNA secondary structures. The mammalian miRNAs that preferentially co-occur with PUM binding sites have recognition seeds that are reverse complements to the PUM recognition motif. Their binding sites have the potential to form hairpin secondary structures with proximal PUM binding sites that would normally limit RISC accessibility, but would be more accessible to miRNAs in response to the binding of PUM. In sum, our computational analyses suggest that a specific set of RBPs and miRNAs work together to affect transcript decay, with the rescue of miRNA recognition sites via RBP binding as one possible mechanism of cooperativity.},

Although Xist RNA is essential for the recruitment of PRC2 to the X chromosome, the precise mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the PRC2 cofactor Jarid2 is an important mediator of Xist-induced PRC2 targeting. The region containing the conserved B and F repeats of Xist is critical for Jarid2 recruitment via its unique N-terminal domain. Xist-induced Jarid2 recruitment occurs chromosome-wide independently of a functional PRC2 complex, unlike at other parts of the genome, such as CG-rich regions, where Jarid2 and PRC2 binding are interdependent. Conversely, we show that Jarid2 loss prevents efficient PRC2 and H3K27me3 enrichment to Xist-coated chromatin. Jarid2 thus represents an important intermediate between PRC2 and Xist RNA for the initial targeting of the PRC2 complex to the X chromosome during onset of XCI.},

Current catalogues of mammalian proteins exhibit an artefactual discontinuity at a length of 100 aa, so that protein abundance peaks just above this length and falls off sharply below it. To clarify the abundance of short proteins, we identify proteins in the FANTOM collection of mouse cDNAs by analysing synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions with the computer program CRITICA. This analysis confirms that there is no real discontinuity at length 100. Roughly 10{\%} of mouse proteins are shorter than 100 aa, although the majority of these are variants of proteins longer than 100 aa. We identify many novel short proteins, including a "dark matter" subset containing ones that lack detectable homology to other known proteins. Translation assays confirm that some of these novel proteins can be translated and localised to the secretory pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in chromatin remodeling, and in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. However, only a few specific lncRNAs are well understood, whereas others are completely uncharacterized. To address this, there is a need for user-friendly platform to studying the putative regulatory functions of human lncRNAs. DESCRIPTION lncRNAMap is an integrated and comprehensive database relating to exploration of the putative regulatory functions of human lncRNAs with two mechanisms of regulation, by encoding siRNAs and by acting as miRNA decoys. To investigate lncRNAs producing siRNAs that regulate protein-coding genes, lncRNAMap integrated small RNAs (sRNAs) that were supported by publicly available deep sequencing data from various sRNA libraries and constructed lncRNA-derived siRNA-target interactions. In addition, lncRNAMap demonstrated that lncRNAs can act as targets for miRNAs that would otherwise regulate protein-coding genes. Previously studies indicated that intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs) either positive or negative regulated neighboring genes, therefore, lncRNAMap surveyed neighboring genes within a 1Mb distance from the genomic location of specific lncRNAs and provided the expression profiles of lncRNA and its neighboring genes. The gene expression profiles may supply the relationship between lncRNA and its neighboring genes. CONCLUSIONS lncRNAMap is a powerful user-friendly platform for the investigation of putative regulatory functions of human lncRNAs with producing siRNAs and acting as miRNA decoy. lncRNAMap is freely available on the web at http://lncRNAMap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/.},

abstract = {The human reference genome is used extensively in modern biological research. However, a single consensus representation is inadequate to provide a universal reference structure because it is a haplotype among many in the human population. Using 10× Genomics (10×G) "Linked-Read" technology, we perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) and de novo assembly on 17 individuals across five populations. We identify 1842 breakpoint-resolved non-reference unique insertions (NUIs) that, in aggregate, add up to 2.1 Mb of so far undescribed genomic content. Among these, 64{\%} are considered ancestral to humans since they are found in non-human primate genomes. Furthermore, 37{\%} of the NUIs can be found in the human transcriptome and 14{\%} likely arose from Alu-recombination-mediated deletion. Our results underline the need of a set of human reference genomes that includes a comprehensive list of alternative haplotypes to depict the complete spectrum of genetic diversity across populations.},

abstract = {In this article, we describe a long-non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and disease association database (LncRNADisease), which is publicly accessible at http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncrnadisease. In recent years, a large number of lncRNAs have been identified and increasing evidence shows that lncRNAs play critical roles in various biological processes. Therefore, the dysfunctions of lncRNAs are associated with a wide range of diseases. It thus becomes important to understand lncRNAs' roles in diseases and to identify candidate lncRNAs for disease diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. For this purpose, a high-quality lncRNA-disease association database would be extremely beneficial. Here, we describe the LncRNADisease database that collected and curated approximately 480 entries of experimentally supported lncRNA-disease associations, including 166 diseases. LncRNADisease also curated 478 entries of lncRNA interacting partners at various molecular levels, including protein, RNA, miRNA and DNA. Moreover, we annotated lncRNA-disease associations with genomic information, sequences, references and species. We normalized the disease name and the type of lncRNA dysfunction and provided a detailed description for each entry. Finally, we developed a bioinformatic method to predict novel lncRNA-disease associations and integrated the method and the predicted associated diseases of 1564 human lncRNAs into the database.},

abstract = {Efforts to identify driver mutations in cancer have largely focused on genes, whereas non-coding sequences remain relatively unexplored. Here we develop a statistical method based on characteristics known to influence local mutation rate and a series of enrichment filters in order to identify distal regulatory elements harboring putative driver mutations in breast cancer. We identify ten DNase I hypersensitive sites that are significantly mutated in breast cancers and associated with the aberrant expression of neighboring genes. A pan-cancer analysis shows that three of these elements are significantly mutated across multiple cancer types and have mutation densities similar to protein-coding driver genes. Functional characterization of the most highly mutated DNase I hypersensitive sites in breast cancer (using in silico and experimental approaches) confirms that they are regulatory elements and affect the expression of cancer genes. Our study suggests that mutations of regulatory elements in tumors likely play an important role in cancer development.Cancer driver mutations can occur within noncoding genomic sequences. Here, the authors develop a statistical approach to identify candidate noncoding driver mutations in DNase I hypersensitive sites in breast cancer and experimentally demonstrate they are regulatory elements of known cancer genes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are non-coding RNAs of length above 200 nucleotides, play important biological functions such as gene expression regulation. To fully reveal the functions of lncRNAs, a fundamental step is to annotate them in various species. However, as lncRNAs tend to encode one or multiple open reading frames, it is not trivial to distinguish these long non-coding transcripts from protein-coding genes in transcriptomic data. RESULTS: In this work, we design a new tool that calculates the coding potential of a transcript using a machine learning model (random forest) based on multiple features including sequence characteristics of putative open reading frames, translation scores based on ribosomal coverage, and conservation against characterized protein families. The experimental results show that our tool competes favorably with existing coding potential computation tools in lncRNA identification.

As the number of experiments increase in a rapid rate and transcriptional units are better annotated, databases indexing lncRNA properties and function gradually become essential tools to this process. Aim of DIANA-LncBase (www.microrna.gr/LncBase) is to reinforce researchers' attempts and unravel microRNA (miRNA)-lncRNA putative functional interactions. This study provides, for the first time, a comprehensive annotation of miRNA targets on lncRNAs. DIANA-LncBase hosts transcriptome-wide experimentally verified and computationally predicted miRNA recognition elements (MREs) on human and mouse lncRNAs. The analysis performed includes an integration of most of the available lncRNA resources, relevant high-throughput HITS-CLIP and PAR-CLIP experimental data as well as state-of-the-art in silico target predictions. The experimentally supported entries available in DIANA-LncBase correspond to {\textgreater}5000 interactions, while the computationally predicted interactions exceed 10 million. DIANA-LncBase hosts detailed information for each miRNA-lncRNA pair, such as external links, graphic plots of transcripts' genomic location, representation of the binding sites, lncRNA tissue expression as well as MREs conservation and prediction scores.},

Machine learning methods have been designed for pre-miRNA identification. However, most of them cannot provide reliable predictive performances on independent testing datasets. We assumed this is because the training sets, especially the negative training sets, are not sufficiently representative. To generate a representative negative set, we proposed a novel negative sample selection technique, and successfully collected negative samples with improved quality. Two recent classifiers rebuilt with the proposed negative set achieved an improvement of {\~{}}6{\%} in their predictive performance, which confirmed this assumption. Based on the proposed negative set, we constructed a training set, and developed an online system called miRNApre specifically for human pre-miRNA identification. We showed that miRNApre achieved accuracies on updated human and non-human datasets that were 34.3{\%} and 7.6{\%} higher than those achieved by current methods. The results suggest that miRNApre is an effective tool for pre-miRNA identification. Additionally, by integrating miRNApre, we developed a miRNA mining tool, mirnaDetect, which can be applied to find potential miRNAs in genome-scale data. MirnaDetect achieved a comparable mining performance on human chromosome 19 data as other existing methods.},

abstract = {A number of methods for recognizing protein coding genes in DNA sequence have been published over the last 13 years, and new, more comprehensive algorithms, drawing on the repertoire of existing techniques, continue to be developed. To optimize continued development, it is valuable to systematically review and evaluate published techniques. At the core of most gene recognition algorithms is one or more coding measures--functions which produce, given any sample window of sequence, a number or vector intended to measure the degree to which a sample sequence resembles a window of 'typical' exonic DNA. In this paper we review and synthesize the underlying coding measures from published algorithms. A standardized benchmark is described, and each of the measures is evaluated according to this benchmark. Our main conclusion is that a very simple and obvious measure--counting oligomers--is more effective than any of the more sophisticated measures. Different measures contain different information. However there is a great deal of redundancy in the current suite of measures. We show that in future development of gene recognition algorithms, attention can probably be limited to six of the twenty or so measures proposed to date.},

Computational approaches for drug repositioning by integrating information from multiple sources and multiple levels have the potential to provide great insights to the complex relationships among drugs, targets, disease genes and diseases at a system level. RESULTS: In this paper, we have proposed a computational framework based on a heterogeneous network model and applied the approach on drug repositioning by utilizing existing omics data about diseases, drugs and drug targets. The novelty of the framework lies in the fact that the strength between a disease-drug pair is calculated through an iterative algorithm on the heterogeneous graph that also incorporates drug-target information. Comprehensive experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several recent approaches. Case studies further illustrate its practical usefulness.

Here, we demonstrate that specific properties of graphs that represent the predicted RNA secondary structure reflect functional information. We introduce a computational algorithm and an associated web-based tool (GraPPLE) for classifying non-coding RNA molecules as functional and, furthermore, into Rfam families based on their graph properties. Unlike sequence-similarity-based methods and covariance models, GraPPLE is demonstrated to be more robust with regard to increasing sequence divergence, and when combined with existing methods, leads to a significant improvement of prediction accuracy. Furthermore, graph properties identified as most informative are shown to provide an understanding as to what particular structural features render RNA molecules functional. Thus, GraPPLE may offer a valuable computational filtering tool to identify potentially interesting RNA molecules among large candidate datasets.},

abstract = {A highly reproducible, commercial and nonlinear, wide-range immobilized pH gradient (IPG) was used to generate two-dimensional (2-D) gel maps of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins from noncultured, unfractionated normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Forty one proteins, common to most human cell types and recorded in the human keratinocyte 2-D gel protein database were identified in the 2-D gel maps and their isoelectric points (pI) were determined using narrow-range IPGs. The latter established a pH scale that allowed comparisons between 2-D gel maps generated either with other IPGs in the first dimension or with different human protein samples. Of the 41 proteins identified, a subset of 18 was defined as suitable to evaluate the correlation between calculated and experimental pI values for polypeptides with known composition. The variance calculated for the discrepancies between calculated and experimental pI values for these proteins was 0.001 pH units. Comparison of the values by the t-test for dependent samples (paired test) gave a p-level of 0.49, indicating that there is no significant difference between the calculated and experimental pI values. The precision of the calculated values depended on the buffer capacity of the proteins, and on average, it improved with increased buffer capacity. As shown here, the widely available information on protein sequences cannot, a priori, be assumed to be sufficient for calculating pI values because post-translational modifications, in particular N-terminal blockage, pose a major problem. Of the 36 proteins analyzed in this study, 18-20 were found to be N-terminally blocked and of these only 6 were indicated as such in databases. The probability of N-terminal blockage depended on the nature of the N-terminal group. Twenty six of the proteins had either M, S or A as N-terminal amino acids and of these 17-19 were blocked. Only 1 in 10 proteins containing other N-terminal groups were blocked.},

LncRNA-protein interaction is the most significant way of lncRNA performing function. Thus, identifying lncRNA-protein interaction has huge significance. The previous methods of lncRNA-protein interaction prediction focus on intrinsic features of lncRNA and protein but ignore the information implicit in the topologies of biological network associated with lncRNA. In this paper, we adopt Hetesim algorithm which can evaluate the relevance between lncRNA and protein based on the heterogeneous lncRNA-protein network to identify lncRNA-protein interacitons.},

Until now, most RNA-Seq studies have depended crucially on existing annotations and thus focused on expression levels and variation in known transcripts. Here, we present Scripture, a method to reconstruct the transcriptome of a mammalian cell using only RNA-Seq reads and the genome sequence. We applied it to mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal precursor cells and lung fibroblasts to accurately reconstruct the full-length gene structures for most known expressed genes. We identified substantial variation in protein coding genes, including thousands of novel 5' start sites, 3' ends and internal coding exons. We then determined the gene structures of more than a thousand large intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) and antisense loci. Our results open the way to direct experimental manipulation of thousands of noncoding RNAs and demonstrate the power of ab initio reconstruction to render a comprehensive picture of mammalian transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Neurodegeneration in the brains of Huntington's disease patients is accompanied by widespread changes in gene regulatory networks. Recent studies have found that these changes are not restricted to protein-coding genes, but also include non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). One particularly abundant but poorly understood class of ncRNAs is the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), of which at least ten thousand have been identified in the human genome. Although we presently know little about their function, lncRNAs are widely expressed in the mammalian nervous system, and many are likely to play critical roles in neuronal development and activity. LncRNAs are now being implicated in neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD). In the present study, I discuss the potential significance of lncRNAs in HD. To support this, I have mined existing microarray data to discover seven new lncRNAs that are dysregulated in HD brains. Interestingly, several of these contain genomic binding sites for the transcriptional repressor REST, a key mediator of transcriptional changes in HD, including the known REST target lncRNA, DGCR5. Previously described lncRNAs TUG1 (necessary for retinal development) and NEAT1 (a structural component of nuclear paraspeckles) are upregulated in HD caudate, while the brain-specific tumour-suppressor MEG3 is downregulated. Three other lncRNAs of unknown function are also significantly changed in HD brains. Many lncRNAs regulate gene expression through formation of epigenetic ribonucleoprotein complexes, including TUG1 and MEG3. These findings lead me to propose that lncRNA expression changes in HD are widespread, that many of these result in altered epigenetic gene regulation in diseased neurons, and that contributes to neurodegeneration. Therefore, elucidating lncRNA network changes in HD may be important in understanding and treating this and other neurodegenerative processes. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Massive studies have indicated that lncRNAs interact with related proteins to exert regulation of cellular biological processes. Due to it is time-consuming and expensive to determine lncRNA-protein interaction by experiment, more accurate predictions of interaction by computational methods are imperative. We propose a novel computational approach, predicting lncRNA-protein interaction using graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (LPGNMF), to discover unobserved lncRNA-protein association. Firstly, we calculate lncRNA similarity and protein similarity by integrating the lncRNA expression information and gene ontology information. Subsequently, we utilize graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization framework to predict potential interactions for all lncRNA simultaneously. In the cross validation test, LPGNMF achieves an AUC of 85.2{\%}, higher than those of other compared methods. In addition, novel lncRNA-protein interactions detected by LPGNMF are validated by literatures or database. The results indicate that our method is effective to discover potential lncRNA-protein interaction.},

Genes associated with similar disorders show both higher likelihood of physical interactions between their products and higher expression profiling similarity for their transcripts, supporting the existence of distinct disease-specific functional modules. We find that essential human genes are likely to encode hub proteins and are expressed widely in most tissues. This suggests that disease genes also would play a central role in thehumaninteractome. In contrast,wefind that the vast majority of disease genes are nonessential and show no tendency to encode hub proteins, and their expression pattern indi- cates that they are localized in the functional periphery of the network. A selection-based model explains the observed difference between essential and disease genes and also suggests that diseases caused by somatic mutations should not be peripheral, a prediction we confirm for cancer genes.},

The third-generation sequencing revolution has also offered longer and more accurate annotations. Moreover, accumulating evidence confirmed by biological experiments has provided more comprehensive knowledge of lncRNA functions.

Additionally, pig was included in the database for the first time, bringing the total number of species to 17. The number of lncRNAs in NONCODEv5 increased from 527 336 to 548 640. NONCODEv5 also introduced three important new features: (i) human lncRNA-disease relationships and single nucleotide polymorphism-lncRNA-disease relationships were constructed; (ii) human exosome lncRNA expression profiles were displayed; (iii) the RNA secondary structures of NONCODE human transcripts were predicted.

abstract = {SUMMARY: Annotating genetic variants, especially non-coding variants, for the purpose of identifying pathogenic variants remains a challenge. Combined annotation-dependent depletion (CADD) is an algorithm designed to annotate both coding and non-coding variants, and has been shown to outperform other annotation algorithms. CADD trains a linear kernel support vector machine (SVM) to differentiate evolutionarily derived, likely benign, alleles from simulated, likely deleterious, variants. However, SVMs cannot capture non-linear relationships among the features, which can limit performance. To address this issue, we have developed DANN. DANN uses the same feature set and training data as CADD to train a deep neural network (DNN). DNNs can capture non-linear relationships among features and are better suited than SVMs for problems with a large number of samples and features. We exploit Compute Unified Device Architecture-compatible graphics processing units and deep learning techniques such as dropout and momentum training to accelerate the DNN training. DANN achieves about a 19{\%} relative reduction in the error rate and about a 14{\%} relative increase in the area under the curve (AUC) metric over CADD's SVM methodology. Availability and implementation: All data and source code are available at https://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/public{\_}data/DANN/. CONTACT: xhx@ics.uci.edu.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex diseases have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) studies. However, few of these SNPs have explicit biological functions. Recent studies indicated that the SNPs within the 3'UTR regions of susceptibility genes could affect complex traits/diseases by affecting the function of miRNAs. These 3'UTR SNPs are functional candidates and therefore of interest to GWAS and eQTL researchers. DESCRIPTION We developed a publicly available online database, MirSNP (http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/mirsnp), which is a collection of human SNPs in predicted miRNA-mRNA binding sites. We identified 414,510 SNPs that might affect miRNA-mRNA binding. Annotations were added to these SNPs to predict whether a SNP within the target site would decrease/break or enhance/create an miRNA-mRNA binding site. By applying MirSNP database to three brain eQTL data sets, we identified four unreported SNPs (rs3087822, rs13042, rs1058381, and rs1058398), which might affect miRNA binding and thus affect the expression of their host genes in the brain. We also applied the MirSNP database to our GWAS for schizophrenia: seven predicted miRNA-related SNPs (p {\textless} 0.0001) were found in the schizophrenia GWAS. Our findings identified the possible functions of these SNP loci, and provide the basis for subsequent functional research. CONCLUSION MirSNP could identify the putative miRNA-related SNPs from GWAS and eQTLs researches and provide the direction for subsequent functional researches.},

In this study, we developed ChIPBase v2.0 (http://rna.sysu.edu.cn/chipbase/) to explore the transcriptional regulatory networks of ncRNAs and PCGs. ChIPBase v2.0 has been expanded with ∼10 200 curated ChIP-seq datasets, which represent about 20 times expansion when comparing to the previous released version. We identified thousands of binding motif matrices and their binding sites from ChIP-seq data of DNA-binding proteins and predicted millions of transcriptional regulatory relationships between transcription factors (TFs) and genes. We constructed 'Regulator' module to predict hundreds of TFs and histone modifications that were involved in or affected transcription of ncRNAs and PCGs. Moreover, we built a web-based tool, Co-Expression, to explore the co-expression patterns between DNA-binding proteins and various types of genes by integrating the gene expression profiles of ∼10 000 tumor samples and ∼9100 normal tissues and cell lines. ChIPBase also provides a ChIP-Function tool and a genome browser to predict functions of diverse genes and visualize various ChIP-seq data. This study will greatly expand our understanding of the transcriptional regulations of ncRNAs and PCGs.},

abstract = {Increasing observations have indicated that lncRNAs play a significant role in various critical biological processes and the development and progression of various human diseases. Constructing lncRNA functional similarity networks could benefit the development of computational models for inferring lncRNA functions and identifying lncRNA-disease associations. However, little effort has been devoted to quantifying lncRNA functional similarity. In this study, we developed an Improved LNCRNA functional SIMilarity calculation model (ILNCSIM) based on the assumption that lncRNAs with similar biological functions tend to be involved in similar diseases. The main improvement comes from the combination of the concept of information content and the hierarchical structure of disease directed acyclic graphs for disease similarity calculation. ILNCSIM was combined with the previously proposed model of Laplacian Regularized Least Squares for lncRNA-Disease Association to further evaluate its performance. As a result, new model obtained reliable performance in the leave-one-out cross validation (AUCs of 0.9316 and 0.9074 based on MNDR and Lnc2cancer databases, respectively), and 5-fold cross validation (AUCs of 0.9221 and 0.9033 for MNDR and Lnc2cancer databases), which significantly improved the prediction performance of previous models. It is anticipated that ILNCSIM could serve as an effective lncRNA function prediction model for future biomedical researches.},

abstract = {RNA-Seq based transcriptome assembly has been widely used to identify novel lncRNAs. However, the best-performing transcript reconstruction methods merely identified 21{\%} of full-length protein-coding transcripts from H. sapiens. Those partial-length protein-coding transcripts are more likely to be classified as lncRNAs due to their incomplete CDS, leading to higher false positive rate for lncRNA identification. Furthermore, potential sequencing or assembly error that gain or abolish stop codons also complicates ORF-based prediction of lncRNAs. Therefore, it remains a challenge to identify lncRNAs from the assembled transcripts, particularly the partial-length ones. Here, we present a novel alignment-free tool, lncScore, which uses a logistic regression model with 11 carefully selected features. Compared to other state-of-the-art alignment-free tools (e.g. CPAT, CNCI, and PLEK), lncScore outperforms them on accurately distinguishing lncRNAs from mRNAs, especially partial-length mRNAs in the human and mouse datasets. In addition, lncScore also performed well on transcripts from five other species (Zebrafish, Fly, C. elegans, Rat, and Sheep). To speed up the prediction, multithreading is implemented within lncScore, and it only took 2 minute to classify 64,756 transcripts and 54 seconds to train a new model with 21,000 transcripts with 12 threads, which is much faster than other tools. lncScore is available at https://github.com/WGLab/lncScore.$\backslash$r$\backslash$n$\backslash$r$\backslash$n},

However, experimental determination of associations between microRNAs and diseases remains challenging.

Therefore, computational methods for microRNA-disease association prediction have gained a lot of research interest.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nMETHODS: Herein, based on the assumption that functionally related microRNAs tend to be associated with phenotypically similar diseases, three inference methods were presented for microRNA-disease association prediction, namely MBSI (microRNA-based similarity inference), PBSI (phenotype-based similarity inference) and NetCBI (network-consistency-based inference). Global network similarity measure was used in the three methods to predict new microRNA-disease associations.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: We tested the three methods on 242 known microRNA-disease associations by leave-one-out cross-validation for prediction evaluation, and achieved AUC values of 74.83{\%}, 54.02{\%} and 80.66{\%}, respectively. The best-performed method NetCBI was then chosen for novel microRNA-disease association prediction. Some associations strongly predicted by NetCBI were confirmed by the publicly accessible databases, which indicated the usefulness of this method. The newly predicted associations were publicly released to facilitate future studies. Moreover, NetCBI was especially applicable to predicting target diseases for microRNAs whose target association information was not available.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: The encouraging results suggest that our method NetCBI can not only provide help in identifying novel microRNA-disease associations but also guide biological experiments for scientific research.},

Despite of the accumulation of lncRNA-disease associations, only a few studies had studied the roles of these associations in pathogenesis. In this paper, we investigated lncRNA-disease associations from a network view to understand the contribution of these lncRNAs to complex diseases. Specifically, we studied both the properties of the diseases in which the lncRNAs were implicated, and that of the lncRNAs associated with complex diseases. Regarding the fact that protein coding genes and lncRNAs are involved in human diseases, we constructed a coding-non-coding gene-disease bipartite network based on known associations between diseases and disease-causing genes. We then applied a propagation algorithm to uncover the hidden lncRNA-disease associations in this network. The algorithm was evaluated by leave-one-out cross validation on 103 diseases in which at least two genes were known to be involved, and achieved an AUC of 0.7881. Our algorithm successfully predicted 768 potential lncRNA-disease associations between 66 lncRNAs and 193 diseases. Furthermore, our results for Alzheimer's disease, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer were verified by other independent studies.},

abstract = {Here, we present LNCipedia (http://www.lncipedia.org), a novel database for human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts and genes. LncRNAs constitute a large and diverse class of non-coding RNA genes. Although several lncRNAs have been functionally annotated, the majority remains to be characterized. Different high-throughput methods to identify new lncRNAs (including RNA sequencing and annotation of chromatin-state maps) have been applied in various studies resulting in multiple unrelated lncRNA data sets. LNCipedia offers 21 488 annotated human lncRNA transcripts obtained from different sources. In addition to basic transcript information and gene structure, several statistics are determined for each entry in the database, such as secondary structure information, protein coding potential and microRNA binding sites. Our analyses suggest that, much like microRNAs, many lncRNAs have a significant secondary structure, in-line with their presumed association with proteins or protein complexes. Available literature on specific lncRNAs is linked, and users or authors can submit articles through a web interface. Protein coding potential is assessed by two different prediction algorithms: Coding Potential Calculator and HMMER. In addition, a novel strategy has been integrated for detecting potentially coding lncRNAs by automatically re-analysing the large body of publicly available mass spectrometry data in the PRIDE database. LNCipedia is publicly available and allows users to query and download lncRNA sequences and structures based on different search criteria. The database may serve as a resource to initiate small- and large-scale lncRNA studies. As an example, the LNCipedia content was used to develop a custom microarray for expression profiling of all available lncRNAs.},

In this paper, we solve the two problems by first introducing the concept of meta-graph to HIN-based recommendation, and then solving the information fusion problem with a " matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM) " approach. For the similarities generated by each meta-graph, we perform standard MF to generate latent features for both users and items. With different meta-graph based features, we propose a group lasso regularized FM to automatically learn from the observed ratings to effectively select useful meta-graph based features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Yelp, show the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art FM and other HIN-based recommendation algorithms.},

Lncident is also much faster than Coding-Potential Calculator and Coding-Noncoding Index. Lncident presents an outstanding performance on microorganism, which offers a great application prospect to the analysis of microorganism. In addition, Lncident can be trained by users' own collected data. Furthermore, R package and web server are simultaneously developed in order to maximize the convenience for the users.

Benchmarking versus five state-of-the-art tools shows that FEELnc achieves similar or better classification performance on GENCODE and NONCODE data sets. The program also provides specific modules that enable the user to fine-tune classification accuracy, to formalize the annotation of lncRNA classes and to identify lncRNAs even in the absence of a training set of non-coding RNAs. We used FEELnc on a real data set comprising 20 canine RNA-seq samples produced by the European LUPA consortium to substantially expand the canine genome annotation to include 10 374 novel lncRNAs and 58 640 mRNA transcripts.

In this study, we propose a network-based computational method, which is called lncRNA-protein interaction prediction based on Heterogeneous Network Model (LPIHN), to predict the potential lncRNA-protein interactions. First, we construct a heterogeneous network by integrating the lncRNA-lncRNA similarity network, lncRNA-protein interaction network, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, a random walk with restart is implemented on the heterogeneous network to infer novel lncRNA-protein interactions. The leave-one-out cross validation test shows that our approach can achieve an AUC value of 96.0{\%}. Some lncRNA-protein interactions predicted by our method have been confirmed in recent research or database, indicating the efficiency of LPIHN to predict novel lncRNA-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Several recent studies indicate that mammals and other organisms produce large numbers of RNA transcripts that do not correspond to known genes. It has been suggested that these transcripts do not encode proteins, but may instead function as RNAs. However, discrimination of coding and non-coding transcripts is not straightforward, and different laboratories have used different methods, whose ability to perform this discrimination is unclear. In this study, we examine ten bioinformatic methods that assess protein-coding potential and compare their ability and congruency in the discrimination of non-coding from coding sequences, based on four underlying principles: open reading frame size, sequence similarity to known proteins or protein domains, statistical models of protein-coding sequence, and synonymous versus non-synonymous substitution rates. Despite these different approaches, the methods show broad concordance, suggesting that coding and non-coding transcripts can, in general, be reliably discriminated, and that many of the recently discovered extra-genic transcripts are indeed non-coding. Comparison of the methods indicates reasons for unreliable predictions, and approaches to increase confidence further. Conversely and surprisingly, our analyses also provide evidence that as much as approximately 10{\%} of entries in the manually curated protein database Swiss-Prot are erroneous translations of actually non-coding transcripts.},

Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.},

Since the first public release of this annotation data set, few new protein-coding loci have been added, yet the number of alternative splicing transcripts annotated has steadily increased. The GENCODE 7 release contains 20,687 protein-coding and 9640 long noncoding RNA loci and has 33,977 coding transcripts not represented in UCSC genes and RefSeq. It also has the most comprehensive annotation of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) loci publicly available with the predominant transcript form consisting of two exons. We have examined the completeness of the transcript annotation and found that 35{\%} of transcriptional start sites are supported by CAGE clusters and 62{\%} of protein-coding genes have annotated polyA sites. Over one-third of GENCODE protein-coding genes are supported by peptide hits derived from mass spectrometry spectra submitted to Peptide Atlas. New models derived from the Illumina Body Map 2.0 RNA-seq data identify 3689 new loci not currently in GENCODE, of which 3127 consist of two exon models indicating that they are possibly unannotated long noncoding loci.

abstract = {Post-transcriptional gene regulation is mediated through complex networks of protein-RNA interactions. The targets of only a few RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are known, even in the well-characterized budding yeast. In silico prediction of protein-RNA interactions is therefore useful to guide experiments and to provide insight into regulatory networks. Computational approaches have identified RBP targets based on sequence binding preferences. We investigate here to what extent RBP-RNA interactions can be predicted based on RBP and mRNA features other than sequence motifs. We analyze global relationships between gene and protein properties in general and between selected RBPs and known mRNA targets in particular. Highly translated RBPs tend to bind to shorter transcripts, and transcripts bound by the same RBP show high expression correlation across different biological conditions. Surprisingly, a given RBP preferentially binds to mRNAs that encode interaction partners for this RBP, suggesting coordinated post-transcriptional auto-regulation of protein complexes. We apply a machine-learning approach to predict specific RBP targets in yeast. Although this approach performs well for RBPs with known targets, predictions for uncharacterized RBPs remain challenging due to limiting experimental data. We also predict targets of fission yeast RBPs, indicating that the suggested framework could be applied to other species once more experimental data are available.},

Long non-coding RNAs serve as pivotal regulators of genes that are able to generate LncRNA-binding protein complexes to modulate a great number of genes. Recently, the LncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been revealed to be dysregulated, which plays a critical role in the development of a few cancers. However, the role of the biology and clinical significance of UCA1 in the tumorigenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remain unknown. We found that UCA1 expression levels were upregulated aberrantly in tongue squamous cell carcinoma tissues and associated with lymph node metastasis and TNM stage. We explored the expression, function, and molecular mechanism of LncRNA UCA1 in OSCC. In the present work, we revealed that UCA1 silencing suppressed proliferation and metastasis and induced apoptosis of OSCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo, which might be related to the activation level of the WNT/{\$}\beta{\$}-catenin signaling pathway. Our research results emphasize the pivotal role of UCA1 in the oncogenesis of OSCC and reveal a novel LncRNA UCA1-{\$}\beta{\$}-catenin-WNT signaling pathway regulatory network that could contribute to our understanding in the pathogenesis of OSCC and assist in the discovery of a viable LncRNA-directed diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for this fatal disease.},

abstract = {A primer extension (toeprinting) assay was used to monitor selection by ribosomes of the first versus the second AUG codon as a function of introducing mutations on the 3' side (positions +4, +5 and +6) of the first AUG codon. Six different flanking codons starting with G (GCG, GCU, GCC, GCA, GAU and GGA) strongly augmented selection of AUG{\#}1 when compared with matched mRNAs that had A or C instead of G in position +4. Augmentation by G in position +4 failed only when it was combined with U in position +5, as in the sequence augGUA. In contrast with the usual enhancing effect of introducing G in position +4, most mutations in position +5 had no discernible effect, as shown with the series augANA (where N = C, A, G or U) and the series augCNA. AUG codon recognition was also unaffected by mutations in position +6, as shown by testing four mRNAs that had augCCN as the start site. Thus the primary sequence context that augments the recognition of AUG start codons does not appear generally to extend beyond G in position +4. When the toeprinting assay was used with mRNAs that initiate translation at CUG instead of AUG, cugGAU was not recognized better than cugGGU, contradicting the hypothesis that initiation at non-AUG codons might be favored by A instead of G in position +5.},

There are several databases that contain microRNA-cancer associations predicted by computational methods but few from empirical results. Despite the fact that abundant experiments investigating microRNA expressions in cancer cells have been carried out, the results have remain scattered in the literature. We propose to extract microRNA-cancer associations by text mining and store them in a database called miRCancer. RESULTS The text mining is based on 75 rules we have constructed, which represent the common sentence structures typically used to state microRNA expressions in cancers. The microRNA-cancer association database, miRCancer, is updated regularly by running the text mining algorithm against PubMed.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite increasing interest in the noncoding fraction of transcriptomes, the number, species-conservation and functions, if any, of many non-protein-coding transcripts remain to be discovered. Two extensive long intergenic noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcript catalogues are now available for mouse: over 3,000 macroRNAs identified by cDNA sequencing, and 1,600 long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) intervals that are predicted from chromatin-state maps. Previously we showed that macroRNAs tend to be more highly conserved than putatively neutral sequence, although only 5{\%} of bases are predicted as constrained. By contrast, over a thousand lincRNAs were reported as being highly conserved. This apparent difference may account for the surprisingly small fraction (11{\%}) of transcripts that are represented in both catalogues. Here we sought to resolve the reported discrepancy between the evolutionary rates for these two sets.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our analyses reveal lincRNA and macroRNA exon sequences to be subject to the same relatively low degree of sequence constraint. Nonetheless, our observations are consistent with the functionality of a fraction of ncRNA in these sets, with up to a quarter of ncRNA exons having evolved significantly slower than neighboring neutral sequence. The more tissue-specific macroRNAs are enriched in predicted RNA secondary structures and thus may often act in trans, whereas the more highly and broadly expressed lincRNAs appear more likely to act in the cis-regulation of adjacent transcription factor genes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our results indicate that each of the two ncRNA catalogues unevenly and lightly samples the true, much larger, ncRNA repertoire of the mouse.},

abstract = {The eukaryotic RNA exosome is an essential, multi-subunit complex that catalyzes RNA turnover, maturation, and quality control processes. Its non-catalytic donut-shaped core includes 9 subunits that associate with the 3' to 5' exoribonucleases Rrp6, and Rrp44/Dis3, a subunit that also catalyzes endoribonuclease activity. Although recent structures and biochemical studies of RNA bound exosomes from S. cerevisiae revealed that the Exo9 central channel guides RNA to either Rrp6 or Rrp44 using partially overlapping and mutually exclusive paths, several issues related to RNA recruitment remain. Here, we identify activities for the highly basic Rrp6 C-terminal tail that we term the 'lasso' because it binds RNA and stimulates ribonuclease activities associated with Rrp44 and Rrp6 within the 11-subunit nuclear exosome. Stimulation is dependent on the Exo9 central channel, and the lasso contributes to degradation and processing activities of exosome substrates in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we present evidence that the Rrp6 lasso may be a conserved feature of the eukaryotic RNA exosome.},

abstract = {Comparisons of orthologous genomic DNA sequences can be used to characterize regions that have been subject to purifying selection and are enriched for functional elements. We here present the results of such an analysis on an alignment of sequences from 29 mammalian species. The alignment captures approximately 3.9 neutral substitutions per site and spans approximately 1.9 Mbp of the human genome. We identify constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in length, covering approximately 5.5{\%} of the human locus. Our estimate for the total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and biologically transparent framework for constrained element identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as "rejected substitutions". Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.},

abstract = {Motivation Identification of disease-associated miRNAs (disease miRNAs) is critical for understanding disease etiology and pathogenesis. Since miRNAs exert their functions by regulating the expression of their target mRNAs, several methods based on the target genes were proposed to predict disease miRNA candidates. They achieved only limited success as they all suffered from the high false-positive rate of target prediction results. Alternatively, other prediction methods were based on the observation that miRNAs with similar functions tend to be associated with similar diseases and vice versa. The methods exploited the information about miRNAs and diseases, including the functional similarities between miRNAs, the similarities between diseases, and the associations between miRNAs and diseases. However, how to integrate the multiple kinds of information completely and consider the biological characteristic of disease miRNAs is a challenging problem. Results We constructed a bilayer network to represent the complex relationships among miRNAs, among diseases and between miRNAs and diseases. We proposed a non-negative matrix factorization based method to rank, so as to predict, the disease miRNA candidates. The method integrated the miRNA functional similarity, the disease similarity, and the miRNA-disease associations seamlessly, which exploited the complex relationships within the bilayer network and the consensus relationship between multiple kinds of information. Considering the correlation between the candidates related to various diseases, it predicted their respective candidates for all the diseases simultaneously. In addition, the sparseness characteristic of disease miRNAs was introduced to generate more reliable prediction model that excludes those noisy candidates. The results on 15 common diseases showed a superior performance of the new method for not only well-characterized diseases but also new ones. A detailed case study on breast neoplasms, colorectal neoplasms, lung neoplasms, and 32 other diseases demonstrated the ability of the method for discovering potential disease miRNAs.

However, experimental methods for determining proteins bound by a specific lncRNA remain expensive, difficult and time-consuming, and only a few theoretical approaches are available for predicting potential lncRNA-protein associations. In this study, we developed a novel matrix factorization computational approach to uncover lncRNA-protein relationships, namely lncRNA-protein interactions prediction by neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization (LPI-NRLMF). Moreover, it is a semi-supervised and does not need negative samples. As a result, new model obtained reliable performance in the leave-one-out cross validation (the AUC of 0.9025 and AUPR of 0.6924), which significantly improved the prediction performance of previous models. Furthermore, the case study demonstrated that many lncRNA-protein interactions predicted by our method can be successfully confirmed by experiments. It is anticipated that LPI-NRLMF could serve as a useful resource for potential lncRNA-protein association identification.},

The method was developed using 12 proteins for which extensive immunochemical analysis has been carried out and subsequently was used to predict antigenic determinants for the following proteins: hepatitis B surface antigen, influenza hemagglutinins, fowl plague virus hemagglutinin, human histocompatibility antigen HLA-B7, human interferons, Escherichia coli and cholera enterotoxins, ragweed allergens Ra3 and Ra5, and streptococcal M protein.

It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpass-ing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordi-nary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images.

abstract = {Motivation Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in complex disease diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, and treatment, but only a small portion of lncRNA-disease associations have been experimentally verified. Various computational models have been proposed to identify lncRNA-disease associations by integrating heterogeneous data sources. However, existing models generally ignore the intrinsic structure of data sources or treat them as equally relevant, while they may not be. Results To accurately identify lncRNA-disease associations, we propose a Matrix Factorization based LncRNA-Disease Association prediction model (MFLDA in short). MFLDA decomposes data matrices of heterogeneous data sources into low-rank matrices via matrix tri-factorization to explore and exploit their intrinsic and shared structure. MFLDA can select and integrate the data sources by assigning different weights to them. An iterative solution is further introduced to simultaneously optimize the weights and low-rank matrices. Next, MFLDA uses the optimized low-rank matrices to reconstruct the lncRNA-disease association matrix and thus to identify potential associations. In five-fold cross validation experiments to identify verified lncRNA-disease associations, MFLDA achieves an Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.7408, at least 3{\%} higher than those given by state-of-the-art data fusion based computational models. An empirical study on identifying masked lncRNA-disease associations again shows that MFLDA can identify potential associations more accurately than competing models. A case study on identifying lncRNAs associated with breast, lung, and stomach cancers show that 38 out of 45 (84{\%}) associations predicted by MFLDA are supported by recent biomedical literature and further proves the capability of MFLDA in identifying novel lncRNA-disease associations. MFLDA is a general data fusion framework, and as such it can be adopted to predict associations between other biological entities.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 Quan Zou et al.MicroRNAs constitute an important class of noncoding, single-stranded, 22 nucleotide long RNA molecules encoded by endogenous genes. They play an important role in regulating gene transcription and the regulation of normal development. MicroRNAs can be associated with disease; however, only a few microRNA-disease associations have been confirmed by traditional experimental approaches. We introduce two methods to predict microRNA-disease association. The first method, KATZ, focuses on integrating the social network analysis method with machine learning and is based on networks derived from known microRNA-disease associations, disease-disease associations, and microRNA-microRNA associations. The other method, CATAPULT, is a supervised machine learning method. We applied the two methods to 242 known microRNA-disease associations and evaluated their performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and 3-fold cross-validation. Experiments proved that our methods outperformed the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Motivation A heterogeneous network topology possessing abundant interactions between biomedical entities has yet to be utilized in similarity-based methods for predicting drug-target associations based on the array of varying features of drugs and their targets. Deep learning reveals features of vertices of a large network that can be adapted in accommodating the similarity-based solutions to provide a flexible method of drug-target prediction. Results We propose a similarity-based drug-target prediction method that enhances existing association discovery methods by using a topology-based similarity measure. DeepWalk, a deep learning method, is adopted in this study to calculate the similarities within Linked Tripartite Network (LTN), a heterogeneous network generated from biomedical linked datasets. This proposed method shows promising results for drug-target association prediction: 98.96{\%} AUC ROC score with a 10-fold cross-validation and 99.25{\%} AUC ROC score with a Monte Carlo cross-validation with LTN. By utilizing DeepWalk, we demonstrate that: (i) this method outperforms other existing topology-based similarity computation methods, (ii) the performance is better for tripartite than with bipartite networks and (iii) the measure of similarity using network topology outperforms the ones derived from chemical structure (drugs) or genomic sequence (targets). Our proposed methodology proves to be capable of providing a promising solution for drug-target prediction based on topological similarity with a heterogeneous network, and may be readily re-purposed and adapted in the existing of similarity-based methodologies.

abstract = {Unwanted side effects of drugs are a burden on patients and a severe impediment in the development of new drugs. At the same time, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the SIDER ('Side Effect Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40{\%} compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39{\%} of drug-ADR pairs, 19{\%} of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs.},

abstract = {A computer program that progressively evaluates the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of a protein along its amino acid sequence has been devised. For this purpose, a hydropathy scale has been composed wherein the hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of each of the 20 amino acid side-chains is taken into consideration. The scale is based on an amalgam of experimental observations derived from the literature. The program uses a moving-segment approach that continuously determines the average hydropathy within a segment of predetermined length as it advances through the sequence. The consecutive scores are plotted from the amino to the carboxy terminus. At the same time, a midpoint line is printed that corresponds to the grand average of the hydropathy of the amino acid compositions found in most of the sequenced proteins. In the case of soluble, globular proteins there is a remarkable correspondence between the interior portions of their sequence and the regions appearing on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line, as well as the exterior portions and the regions on the hydrophilic side. The correlation was demonstrated by comparisons between the plotted values and known structures determined by crystallography. In the case of membrane-bound proteins, the portions of their sequences that are located within the lipid bilayer are also clearly delineated by large uninterrupted areas on the hydrophobic side of the midpoint line. As such, the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins can be identified by this procedure. Although the method is not unique and embodies principles that have long been appreciated, its simplicity and its graphic nature make it a very useful tool for the evaluation of protein structures. {\textcopyright}1982.},

abstract = {We have conducted a comprehensive search for conserved elements in vertebrate genomes, using genome-wide multiple alignments of five vertebrate species (human, mouse, rat, chicken, and Fugu rubripes). Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae), two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces. Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate the model across species groups, and then predicting conserved elements based on this model. The predicted elements cover roughly 3{\%}-8{\%} of the human genome (depending on the details of the calibration procedure) and substantially higher fractions of the more compact Drosophila melanogaster (37{\%}-53{\%}), Caenorhabditis elegans (18{\%}-37{\%}), and Saccharaomyces cerevisiae (47{\%}-68{\%}) genomes. From yeasts to vertebrates, in order of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons of known protein-coding genes. In all groups, the most highly conserved elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved, and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

abstract = {Most common genetic disorders have a complex inheritance and may result from variants in many genes, each contributing only weak effects to the disease. Pinpointing these disease genes within the myriad of susceptibility loci identified in linkage studies is difficult because these loci may contain hundreds of genes. However, in any disorder, most of the disease genes will be involved in only a few different molecular pathways. If we know something about the relationships between the genes, we can assess whether some genes (which may reside in different loci) functionally interact with each other, indicating a joint basis for the disease etiology. There are various repositories of information on pathway relationships. To consolidate this information, we developed a functional human gene network that integrates information on genes and the functional relationships between genes, based on data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database, Reactome, the Human Protein Reference Database, the Gene Ontology database, predicted protein-protein interactions, human yeast two-hybrid interactions, and microarray coexpressions. We applied this network to interrelate positional candidate genes from different disease loci and then tested 96 heritable disorders for which the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database reported at least three disease genes. Artificial susceptibility loci, each containing 100 genes, were constructed around each disease gene, and we used the network to rank these genes on the basis of their functional interactions. By following up the top five genes per artificial locus, we were able to detect at least one known disease gene in 54{\%} of the loci studied, representing a 2.8-fold increase over random selection. This suggests that our method can significantly reduce the cost and effort of pinpointing true disease genes in analyses of disorders for which numerous loci have been reported but for which most of the genes are unknown.},

abstract = {This note discusses Rcpp modules. Rcpp modules allow programmers to expose C++ functions and classes to R with relative ease. Rcpp modules are inspired from the Boost.Python C++ library (Abrahams and Grosse-Kunstleve, 2003) which provides similar features for Python. 1 Motivation Exposing C++ functionality to R is greatly facilitated by the Rcpp package and its underlying C++ library (Eddelbuettel, Fran{\c{c}}ois, Allaire, Ushey, Kou, Chambers, and Bates, 2016; Eddelbuettel and Fran{\c{c}}ois, 2011). Rcpp smoothes many of the rough edges in R and C++ integration by replacing the traditional R Application Programming Interface (API) described in 'Writing R Extensions' (R Development Core Team, 2015) with a consistent set of C++ classes. The 'Rcpp-introduction' vignette (Eddelbuettel et al., 2016; Eddelbuettel and Fran{\c{c}}ois, 2011) describes the API and provides an introduction to using Rcpp. These Rcpp facilities offer a lot of assistance to the programmer wishing to interface R and C++. At the same time, these facilities are limited as they operate on a function-by-function basis. The programmer has to implement a .Call compatible function (to conform to the R API) using classes of the Rcpp API as described in the next section.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated to a plethora of cellular functions, most of which require the interaction with one or more RNA-binding proteins (RBPs); similarly, RBPs are often able to bind a large number of different RNAs. The currently available knowledge is already drawing an intricate network of interactions, whose deregulation is frequently associated to pathological states. Several different techniques were developed in the past years to obtain protein-RNA binding data in a high-throughput fashion. In parallel, in silico inference methods were developed for the accurate computational prediction of the interaction of RBP-lncRNA pairs. The field is growing rapidly, and it is foreseeable that in the near future, the protein-lncRNA interaction network will rise, offering essential clues for a better understanding of lncRNA cellular mechanisms and their disease-associated perturbations.},

abstract = {The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (www.hmdb.ca) is a resource dedicated to providing scientists with the most current and comprehensive coverage of the human metabolome. Since its first release in 2007, the HMDB has been used to facilitate research for nearly 1000 published studies in metabolomics, clinical biochemistry and systems biology. The most recent release of HMDB (version 3.0) has been significantly expanded and enhanced over the 2009 release (version 2.0). In particular, the number of annotated metabolite entries has grown from 6500 to more than 40,000 (a 600{\%} increase). This enormous expansion is a result of the inclusion of both 'detected' metabolites (those with measured concentrations or experimental confirmation of their existence) and 'expected' metabolites (those for which biochemical pathways are known or human intake/exposure is frequent but the compound has yet to be detected in the body). The latest release also has greatly increased the number of metabolites with biofluid or tissue concentration data, the number of compounds with reference spectra and the number of data fields per entry. In addition to this expansion in data quantity, new database visualization tools and new data content have been added or enhanced. These include better spectral viewing tools, more powerful chemical substructure searches, an improved chemical taxonomy and better, more interactive pathway maps. This article describes these enhancements to the HMDB, which was previously featured in the 2009 NAR Database Issue. (Note to referees, HMDB 3.0 will go live on 18 September 2012.).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The GENCODE consortium was formed to identify and map all protein-coding genes within the ENCODE regions. This was achieved by a combination of initial manual annotation by the HAVANA team, experimental validation by the GENCODE consortium and a refinement of the annotation based on these experimental results.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The GENCODE gene features are divided into eight different categories of which only the first two (known and novel coding sequence) are confidently predicted to be protein-coding genes. 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and RT-PCR were used to experimentally verify the initial annotation. Of the 420 coding loci tested, 229 RACE products have been sequenced. They supported 5' extensions of 30 loci and new splice variants in 50 loci. In addition, 46 loci without evidence for a coding sequence were validated, consisting of 31 novel and 15 putative transcripts. We assessed the comprehensiveness of the GENCODE annotation by attempting to validate all the predicted exon boundaries outside the GENCODE annotation. Out of 1,215 tested in a subset of the ENCODE regions, 14 novel exon pairs were validated, only two of them in intergenic regions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: In total, 487 loci, of which 434 are coding, have been annotated as part of the GENCODE reference set available from the UCSC browser. Comparison of GENCODE annotation with RefSeq and ENSEMBL show only 40{\%} of GENCODE exons are contained within the two sets, which is a reflection of the high number of alternative splice forms with unique exons annotated. Over 50{\%} of coding loci have been experimentally verified by 5' RACE for EGASP and the GENCODE collaboration is continuing to refine its annotation of 1{\%} human genome with the aid of experimental validation.},

abstract = {Common themes are emerging in the molecular mechanisms of long non-coding RNA-mediated gene repression. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in targeted gene silencing through chromatin remodelling, nuclear reorganisation, formation of a silencing domain and precise control over the entry of genes into silent compartments. The similarities suggest that these are fundamental processes of transcription regulation governed by lncRNAs. These findings have paved the way for analogous investigations on other lncRNAs and chromatin remodelling enzymes. Here we discuss these common mechanisms and provide our view on other molecules that warrant similar investigations. We also present our concepts on the possible mechanisms that may facilitate the exit of genes from the silencing domains and their potential therapeutic applications. Finally, we point to future areas of research and put forward our recommendations for improvements in resources and applications of existing technologies towards targeted outcomes in this active area of research.},

abstract = {A major proportion of the mammalian transcriptome comprises long RNAs that have little or no protein-coding capacity (ncRNAs). Only a handful of such transcripts have been examined in detail, and it is unknown whether this class of transcript is generally functional or merely artifact. Using in situ hybridization data from the Allen Brain Atlas, we identified 849 ncRNAs (of 1,328 examined) that are expressed in the adult mouse brain and found that the majority were associated with specific neuroanatomical regions, cell types, or subcellular compartments. Examination of their genomic context revealed that the ncRNAs were expressed from diverse places including intergenic, intronic, and imprinted loci and that many overlap with, or are transcribed antisense to, protein-coding genes of neurological importance. Comparisons between the expression profiles of ncRNAs and their associated protein-coding genes revealed complex relationships that, in combination with the specific expression profiles exhibited at both regional and subcellular levels, are inconsistent with the notion that they are transcriptional noise or artifacts of chromatin remodeling. Our results show that the majority of ncRNAs are expressed in the brain and provide strong evidence that the majority of processed transcripts with no protein-coding capacity function intrinsically as RNAs.},

abstract = {Existing approaches to protein secondary structure prediction from the amino acid sequence usually rely on the statistics of local residue interactions within a sliding window and the secondary structural state of the central residue. The practically achieved accuracy limit of such single residue and single sequence prediction methods is 65{\%} in three structural stages (alpha-helix, beta-strand and coil). Further improvement in the prediction quality is likely to require exploitation of various aspects of three-dimensional protein architecture. Here we make such an attempt and present an accurate algorithm for secondary structure prediction based on recognition of potentially hydrogen-bonded residues in a single amino acid sequence. The unique feature of our approach involves database-derived statistics on residue type occurrences in different classes of beta-bridges to delineate interacting beta-strands. The alpha-helical structures are also recognized on the basis of amino acid occurrences in hydrogen-bonded pairs (i,i + 4). The algorithm has a prediction accuracy of 68{\%} in three structural stages, relies only on a single protein sequence as input and has the potential to be improved by 5-7{\%} if homologous aligned sequences are also considered.},

This study proposes a novel computational method, named KRWRH, to infer disease-lincRNA associations with the influence of phenotype information and tissue expression details of lincRNA. Gaussian interaction profile kernel is calculated for diseases and lincRNAs and random walk with restart method is used for final prediction. The proposed method KRWRH is compared with four existing methods: LRLSLDA, TslncRNA, NRWRH, and RWRH. The experimental results based on the leave-one-out cross validation, ROC curves, and mean enrichment show that the proposed method KRWRH is able to predict known and unknown disease-lincRNA associations more effectively.},

The platform-independent haptic soft keyboard was verified on both Android and Windows. In addition, a psychophysical experiment has been conducted to find an optimal strength of key click feedback on touchscreens, and the perception result was applied for making uniform tactile forces on touchscreens. The developed haptic soft keyboard can be easily integrated with existing tablets by putting the least amount of effort. The evaluation results confirm platform independency, fast tactile key click feedback, and uniform tactile force distribution on touchscreen with using only two piezoelectric actuators.

In this study, we describe deepBase v2.0 (http://biocenter.sysu.edu.cn/deepBase/), an updated platform, to decode evolution, expression patterns and functions of diverse ncRNAs across 19 species. deepBase v2.0 has been updated to provide the most comprehensive collection of ncRNA-derived small RNAs generated from 588 sRNA-Seq datasets. Moreover, we developed a pipeline named lncSeeker to identify 176 680 high-confidence lncRNAs from 14 species. Temporal and spatial expression patterns of various ncRNAs were profiled. We identified approximately 24 280 primate-specific, 5193 rodent-specific lncRNAs, and 55 highly conserved lncRNA orthologs between human and zebrafish. We annotated 14 867 human circRNAs, 1260 of which are orthologous to mouse circRNAs. By combining expression profiles and functional genomic annotations, we developed lncFunction web-server to predict the function of lncRNAs based on protein-lncRNA co-expression networks. This study is expected to provide considerable resources to facilitate future experimental studies and to uncover ncRNA functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technology promises to discover novel protein-coding and non-coding transcripts, particularly the identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from de novo sequencing data. This requires tools that are not restricted by prior gene annotations, genomic sequences and high-quality sequencing. RESULTS: We present an alignment-free tool called PLEK (predictor of long non-coding RNAs and messenger RNAs based on an improved k-mer scheme), which uses a computational pipeline based on an improved k-mer scheme and a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to distinguish lncRNAs from messenger RNAs (mRNAs), in the absence of genomic sequences or annotations. The performance of PLEK was evaluated on well-annotated mRNA and lncRNA transcripts. 10-fold cross-validation tests on human RefSeq mRNAs and GENCODE lncRNAs indicated that our tool could achieve accuracy of up to 95.6{\%}. We demonstrated the utility of PLEK on transcripts from other vertebrates using the model built from human datasets. PLEK attained {\textgreater}90{\%} accuracy on most of these datasets. PLEK also performed well using a simulated dataset and two real de novo assembled transcriptome datasets (sequenced by PacBio and 454 platforms) with relatively high indel sequencing errors. In addition, PLEK is approximately eightfold faster than a newly developed alignment-free tool, named Coding-Non-Coding Index (CNCI), and 244 times faster than the most popular alignment-based tool, Coding Potential Calculator (CPC), in a single-threading running manner. CONCLUSIONS: PLEK is an efficient alignment-free computational tool to distinguish lncRNAs from mRNAs in RNA-seq transcriptomes of species lacking reference genomes. PLEK is especially suitable for PacBio or 454 sequencing data and large-scale transcriptome data. Its open-source software can be freely downloaded from https://sourceforge.net/projects/plek/files/.},

In this study, we developed mirTools 2.0, an updated version of mirTools 1.0, which includes the following new features. (1) From miRNA discovery in mirTools 1.0, mirTools 2.0 allows users to detect and profile various types of ncRNAs, such as miRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, rRNA, and piRNA. (2) From miRNA profiling in mirTools 1.0, mirTools 2.0 allows users to identify miRNA-targeted genes and performs detailed functional annotation of miRNA targets, including Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway and protein-protein interaction. (3) From comparison of two samples for differentially expressed miRNAs in mirTools 1.0, mirTools 2.0 allows users to detect differentially expressed ncRNAs between two experimental groups or among multiple samples. (4) Other significant improvements include strategies used to detect novel miRNAs and piRNAs, more taxonomy categories to discover more known miRNAs and a stand-alone version of mirTools 2.0.

abstract = {BACKGROUND RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) play important roles in a wide variety of cellular processes, ranging from transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression to host defense against pathogens. High throughput experiments to identify RNA-protein interactions are beginning to provide valuable information about the complexity of RNA-protein interaction networks, but are expensive and time consuming. Hence, there is a need for reliable computational methods for predicting RNA-protein interactions. RESULTS We propose RPISeq, a family of classifiers for predicting RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information. Given the sequences of an RNA and a protein as input, RPIseq predicts whether or not the RNA-protein pair interact. The RNA sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its ribonucleotide 4-mer composition, and the protein sequence is encoded as a normalized vector of its 3-mer composition, based on a 7-letter reduced alphabet representation. Two variants of RPISeq are presented: RPISeq-SVM, which uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and RPISeq-RF, which uses a Random Forest classifier. On two non-redundant benchmark datasets extracted from the Protein-RNA Interface Database (PRIDB), RPISeq achieved an AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve) of 0.96 and 0.92. On a third dataset containing only mRNA-protein interactions, the performance of RPISeq was competitive with that of a published method that requires information regarding many different features (e.g., mRNA half-life, GO annotations) of the putative RNA and protein partners. In addition, RPISeq classifiers trained using the PRIDB data correctly predicted the majority (57-99{\%}) of non-coding RNA-protein interactions in NPInter-derived networks from E. coli, S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. CONCLUSIONS Our experiments with RPISeq demonstrate that RNA-protein interactions can be reliably predicted using only sequence-derived information. RPISeq offers an inexpensive method for computational construction of RNA-protein interaction networks, and should provide useful insights into the function of non-coding RNAs. RPISeq is freely available as a web-based server at http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/.},

abstract = {Motivation: Increasing evidences suggest that most of the genome is transcribed into RNAs, but many of them are not translated into proteins. All those RNAs that do not become proteins are called "non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs)", which outnumbers protein-coding genes. Interestingly, these ncRNAs are shown to be more tissue specifically expressed than protein-coding genes. Given that tissue-specific expressions of transcripts suggest their importance in the expressed tissue, researchers are conducting biological experiments to elucidate the function of such ncRNAs. Owing greatly to the advancement of next generation techniques, especially RNA-seq, the amount of high-throughput data are increasing rapidly. However, due to the complexity of the data as well as its high volume, it is not easy to re-analyze such data to extract tissue-specific expressions of ncRNAs from published datasets. Results: Here, we introduce a new knowledge database called "C-It-Loci", which allows a user to screen for tissue-specific transcripts across three organisms: human, mouse, and zebrafish. C-It-Loci is very intuitive and easy to use to identify not only protein-coding genes but also ncRNAs from various tissues. C-It-Loci defines homology through sequence and positional conservation to allow for the extraction of species-conserved loci. C-It-Loci can be used as a starting point for further biological experiments. Availability: C-It-Loci is freely available online without registration at http://c-it-loci.uni-frankfurt.de.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE User performance, perceived usability, and preference for five smartphone text input methods were compared with younger and older novice adults. BACKGROUND Smartphones are used for a variety of functions other than phone calls, including text messaging, e-mail, and web browsing. Research comparing performance with methods of text input on smartphones reveals a high degree of variability in reported measures, procedures, and results. This study reports on a direct comparison of five of the most common input methods among a population of younger and older adults, who had no experience with any of the methods. METHOD Fifty adults (25 younger, 18-35 years; 25 older, 60-84 years) completed a text entry task using five text input methods (physical Qwerty, onscreen Qwerty, tracing, handwriting, and voice). Entry and error rates, perceived usability, and preference were recorded. RESULTS Both age groups input text equally fast using voice input, but older adults were slower than younger adults using all other methods. Both age groups had low error rates when using physical Qwerty and voice, but older adults committed more errors with the other three methods. Both younger and older adults preferred voice and physical Qwerty input to the remaining methods. Handwriting consistently performed the worst and was rated lowest by both groups. CONCLUSION Voice and physical Qwerty input methods proved to be the most effective for both younger and older adults, and handwriting input was the least effective overall. APPLICATION These findings have implications to the design of future smartphone text input methods and devices, particularly for older adults.},

abstract = {Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) were recently discovered as endogenous small noncoding RNAs. Some recent research suggests that piRNAs may play an important role in cancer. So the precise identification of human piRNAs is a significant work. In this paper, we introduce a series of new features with 80 dimension called short sequence motifs (SSM). A hybrid feature vector with 1444 dimension can be formed by combining 1364 features of [Formula: see text]-mer strings and 80 features of SSM features. We optimize the 1444 dimension features using the feature score criterion (FSC) and list them in descending order according to the scores. The first 462 are selected as the input feature vector in the classifier. Moreover, eight of 80 SSM features appear in the top 20. This indicates that these eight SSM features play an important part in the identification of piRNAs. Since five of the above eight SSM features are associated with nucleotide A and G ('A*G', 'A**G', 'A***G', 'A****G', 'A*****G'). So, we guess there may exist some biological significance. We also use a neural network algorithm called voting-based extreme learning machine (V-ELM) to identify real piRNAs. The Specificity (Sp) and Sensitivity (Sn) of our method are 95.48{\%} and 94.61{\%}, respectively in human species.

abstract = {Objectives: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been underlined as a promising potential biomarker for breast cancer but are limited to tissue specimens. Clinical specimens of sera are more abundant and more conveniently collected than tissues. This work was designed to investigate the expression and correlation of a selected panel of miRNAs associated with breast tumor in tissues and matching serum samples. Methods: Tumor tissues, adjacent non-tumor tissues and matching serum samples were collected from 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast tumors. Normal control sera were collected from 40 healthy subjects. A panel of 6 miRNAs (miRNA-21, 106a, 126, 155, 199a and 335) were selected and their aberrant expression levels were quantified by using real-time PCR technique. Results: A high correlation of miRNA expression level was found between breast tumor tissues and sera. MiR-21, miR-106a and miR-155 were significantly over-expressed in the tumor specimens compared with those in normal controls (P {\textless}0.05), whereas miR-126, miR-199a and miR-335 were significantly under-expressed (P {\textless}0.05). Furthermore, the relative expression of miR-21, miR-126, miR-155, miR-199a and miR-335 was closely associated with clinicopathologic features of breast cancer (P {\textless}0.05), such as histological tumor grades and sex hormone receptor expression. Conclusions: Selective expression and modulation of miRNAs could be potential blood-based biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis, grading and prognosis. Our results should encourage further studies on the use of miRNAs in serum samples as an easy and convenient method of breast cancer screening. {\textcopyright}2010 Elsevier Inc.

Current genomic annotations tend to exploit a single information type (e.g. conservation) and/or are restricted in scope (e.g. to missense changes). Here, we describe Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD), a framework that objectively integrates many diverse annotations into a single, quantitative score. We implement CADD as a support vector machine trained to differentiate 14.7 million high-frequency human derived alleles from 14.7 million simulated variants. We pre-compute “C-scores” for all 8.6 billion possible human single nucleotide variants and enable scoring of short insertions/deletions. C-scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects, and complex trait associations, and highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes. The ability of CADD to prioritize functional, deleterious, and pathogenic variants across many functional categories, effect sizes and genetic architectures is unmatched by any current annotation.

abstract = {The central nervous system (CNS) is a complex biological system composed of numerous cell types working in concert. The intricate development and functioning of this highly ordered structure depends upon exquisite spatial and temporal control of gene expression in the cells comprising the CNS. Thus, gene regulatory networks that control cell fates and functions play critical roles in the CNS. Failure to develop and maintain intricate regulatory networks properly leads to impaired development or neural dysfunction, which might manifest as neurological disorders. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important components of gene regulatory networks, working in concert with transcription factors and epigenetic regulators of gene expression. Interestingly, many lncRNAs are highly expressed in the adult and developing brain, often showing precise temporal and spatial patterns of expression. This specificity of expression and growing awareness of the importance of lncRNAs suggest that they play key roles in CNS development and function. In this review, we highlight the growing evidence for the importance of lncRNAs in the CNS and the indications that their dysregulation underlies some neurological disorders.},

abstract = {LncRNAs have attracted lots of attentions from researchers worldwide in recent decades. With the rapid advances in both experimental technology and computational prediction algorithm, thousands of lncRNA have been identified in eukaryotic organisms ranging from nematodes to humans in the past few years. More and more research evidences have indicated that lncRNAs are involved in almost the whole life cycle of cells through different mechanisms and play important roles in many critical biological processes. Therefore, it is not surprising that the mutations and dysregulations of lncRNAs would contribute to the development of various human complex diseases. In this review, we first made a brief introduction about the functions of lncRNAs, five important lncRNA-related diseases, five critical disease-related lncRNAs and some important publicly available lncRNA-related databases about sequence, expression, function, etc. Nowadays, only a limited number of lncRNAs have been experimentally reported to be related to human diseases. Therefore, analyzing available lncRNA-disease associations and predicting potential human lncRNA-disease associations have become important tasks of bioinformatics, which would benefit human complex diseases mechanism understanding at lncRNA level, disease biomarker detection and disease diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention. Furthermore, we introduced some state-of-the-art computational models, which could be effectively used to identify disease-related lncRNAs on a large scale and select the most promising disease-related lncRNAs for experimental validation. We also analyzed the limitations of these models and discussed the future directions of developing computational models for lncRNA research.},

abstract = {Chromosome I from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains a DNA molecule of approximately 231 kbp and is the smallest naturally occurring functional eukaryotic nuclear chromosome so far characterized. The nucleotide sequence of this chromosome has been determined as part of an international collaboration to sequence the entire yeast genome. The chromosome contains 89 open reading frames and 4 tRNA genes. The central 165 kbp of the chromosome resembles other large sequenced regions of the yeast genome in both its high density and distribution of genes. In contrast, the remaining sequences flanking this DNA that comprise the two ends of the chromosome and make up more than 25{\%} of the DNA molecule have a much lower gene density, are largely not transcribed, contain no genes essential for vegetative growth, and contain several apparent pseudogenes and a 15-kbp redundant sequence. These terminally repetitive regions consist of a telomeric repeat called W', flanked by DNA closely related to the yeast FLO1 gene. The low gene density, presence of pseudogenes, and lack of expression are consistent with the idea that these terminal regions represent the yeast equivalent of heterochromatin. The occurrence of such a high proportion of DNA with so little information suggests that its presence gives this chromosome the critical length required for proper function.},

@article{Eisenberg1984,
abstract = {An algorithm has been developed which identifies alpha-helices involved in the interactions of membrane proteins with lipid bilayers and which distinguishes them from helices in soluble proteins. The membrane-associated helices are then classified with the aid of the hydrophobic moment plot, on which the hydrophobic moment of each helix is plotted as a function of its hydrophobicity. The magnitude of hydrophobic moment measures the amphiphilicity of the helix (and hence its tendency to seek a surface between hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases), and the hydrophobicity measures its affinity for the membrane interior. Segments of membrane proteins in alpha-helices tend to fall in one of three regions of a hydrophobic moment plot: (1) monomeric transmembrane anchors (class I HLA transmembrane sequences) lie in the region of highest hydrophobicity and smallest hydrophobic moment; (2) helices presumed to be paired (such as the transmembrane M segments of surface immunoglobulins) and helices which are bundled together in membranes (such as bacteriorhodopsin) fall in the adjacent region with higher hydrophobic moment and smaller hydrophobicity; and (3) helices from surface-seeking proteins (such as melittin) fall in the region with still higher hydrophobic moment. alpha-Helices from globular proteins mainly fall in a region of lower mean hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment. Application of these methods to the sequence of diphtheria toxin suggests four transmembrane helices and a surface-seeking helix in fragment B, the moiety known to have transmembrane function.},

This discovery of large and 'hidden' transcriptome rejuvenates the demand for methods that can rapidly distinguish between coding and noncoding RNA. Here, we present a novel alignment-free method, Coding Potential Assessment Tool (CPAT), which rapidly recognizes coding and noncoding transcripts from a large pool of candidates. To this end, CPAT uses a logistic regression model built with four sequence features: open reading frame size, open reading frame coverage, Fickett TESTCODE statistic and hexamer usage bias. CPAT software outperformed (sensitivity: 0.96, specificity: 0.97) other state-of-the-art alignment-based software such as Coding-Potential Calculator (sensitivity: 0.99, specificity: 0.74) and Phylo Codon Substitution Frequencies (sensitivity: 0.90, specificity: 0.63). In addition to high accuracy, CPAT is approximately four orders of magnitude faster than Coding-Potential Calculator and Phylo Codon Substitution Frequencies, enabling its users to process thousands of transcripts within seconds. The software accepts input sequences in either FASTA- or BED-formatted data files. We also developed a web interface for CPAT that allows users to submit sequences and receive the prediction results almost instantly.},

abstract = {To find signature features shared by various ncRNA sub-types and characterize novel ncRNAs, we have developed a method, RNAfeature, to investigate {\textgreater}600 sets of genomic and epigenomic data with various evolutionary and biophysical scores. RNAfeature utilizes a fine-tuned intra-species wrapper algorithm that is followed by a novel feature selection strategy across species. It considers long distance effect of certain features (e.g. histone modification at the promoter region). We finally narrow down on 10 informative features (including sequences, structures, expression profiles and epigenetic signals). These features are complementary to each other and as a whole can accurately distinguish canonical ncRNAs from CDSs and UTRs (accuracies: {\textgreater}92{\%} in human, mouse, worm and fly). Moreover, the feature pattern is conserved across multiple species. For instance, the supervised 10-feature model derived from animal species can predict ncRNAs in Arabidopsis (accuracy: 82{\%}). Subsequently, we integrate the 10 features to define a set of noncoding potential scores, which can identify, evaluate and characterize novel noncoding RNAs. The score covers all transcribed regions (including unconserved ncRNAs), without requiring assembly of the full-length transcripts. Importantly, the noncoding potential allows us to identify and characterize potential functional domains with feature patterns similar to canonical ncRNAs (e.g. tRNA, snRNA, miRNA, etc) on ∼70{\%} of human long ncRNAs (lncRNAs).},

Predicting potential miRNA-disease associations from vast amount of biological data is an important problem in the biomedical research. Considering the limitations in previous methods, we developed Regularized Least Squares for MiRNA-Disease Association (RLSMDA) to uncover the relationship between diseases and miRNAs. RLSMDA can work for diseases without known related miRNAs. Furthermore, it is a semi-supervised (does not need negative samples) and global method (prioritize associations for all the diseases simultaneously). Based on leave-one-out cross validation, reliable AUC have demonstrated the reliable performance of RLSMDA. We also applied RLSMDA to Hepatocellular cancer and Lung cancer and implemented global prediction for all the diseases simultaneously. As a result, 80{\%} (Hepatocellular cancer) and 84{\%} (Lung cancer) of top 50 predicted miRNAs and 75{\%} of top 20 potential associations based on global prediction have been confirmed by biological experiments. We also applied RLSMDA to diseases without known related miRNAs in golden standard dataset. As a result, in the top 3 potential related miRNA list predicted by RLSMDA for 32 diseases, 34 disease-miRNA associations were successfully confirmed by experiments. It is anticipated that RLSMDA would be a useful bioinformatics resource for biomedical researches.},

Many computational models construct various lncRNA similarity networks, disease similarity networks, along with known lncRNA-disease associations to infer novel associations. However, most of them neglect the structural difference between lncRNAs network and diseases network, hierarchical relationships between diseases and pattern of newly discovered associations. In this study, we developed a model that performs B i- R andom W alks to predict novel L ncRNA- D isease A ssociations (BRWLDA in short). This model utilizes multiple heterogeneous data to construct the lncRNA functional similarity network, and Disease Ontology to construct a disease network. It then constructs a directed bi-relational network based on these two networks and available lncRNAs-disease associations. Next, it applies bi-random walks on the network to predict potential associations. BRWLDA achieves reliable and better performance than other comparing methods not only on experiment verified associations, but also on the simulated experiments with masked associations. Case studies further demonstrate the feasibility of BRWLDA in identifying new lncRNA-disease associations.},

abstract = {As a novel class of noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been verified to be associated with various diseases. As large scale transcripts are generated every year, it is significant to accurately and quickly identify lncRNAs from thousands of assembled transcripts. To accurately discover new lncRNAs, we develop a classification tool of random forest (RF) named LncRNApred based on a new hybrid feature. This hybrid feature set includes three new proposed features, which are MaxORF, RMaxORF and SNR. LncRNApred is effective for classifying lncRNAs and protein coding transcripts accurately and quickly. Moreover,our RF model only requests the training using data on human coding and non-coding transcripts. Other species can also be predicted by using LncRNApred. The result shows that our method is more effective compared with the Coding Potential Calculate (CPC).

abstract = {The eukaryotic ribonuclease for mitochondrial RNA processing (RNase MRP) is mainly located in the nucleoli and belongs to the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) particles. RNase MRP is involved in the processing of pre-rRNA and the generation of RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication. A closely related snoRNP, which shares protein subunits with RNase MRP and contains a structurally related RNA subunit, is the pre-tRNA processing factor RNase P. Up to now, 10 protein subunits of these complexes have been described, designated hPop1, hPop4, hPop5, Rpp14, Rpp20, Rpp21, Rpp25, Rpp30, Rpp38 and Rpp40. To get more insight into the assembly of the human RNase MRP complex we studied protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions by means of GST pull-down experiments. A total of 19 direct protein-protein and six direct protein-RNA interactions were observed. The analysis of mutant RNase MRP RNAs showed that distinct regions are involved in the direct interaction with protein subunits. The results provide insight into the way the protein and RNA subunits assemble into a ribonucleoprotein particle. Based upon these data a new model for the architecture of the human RNase MRP complex was generated.},

Application of technological advances to research into the function of lncRNAs is extremely important. The major tools for exploring lncRNAs include microarrays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), Northern blotting, real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA interference (RNAi), RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP), chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP), crosslinking-immunopurification (CLIP), and bioinformatic prediction.

abstract = {The human genome contains many thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). While several studies have demon- strated compelling biological and disease roles for individual examples, analytical and experimental approaches to in- vestigate these genes have been hampered by the lack of comprehensive lncRNA annotation. Here, we present and analyze the most complete human lncRNA annotation to date, produced by the GENCODE consortium within the framework of the ENCODE project and comprising 9277 manually annotated genes producing 14,880 transcripts. Our analyses indicate that lncRNAs are generated through pathways similar to that of protein-coding genes, with similar histone-modification profiles, splicing signals, and exon/intron lengths. In contrast to protein-coding genes, however, lncRNAs display a striking bias toward two-exon transcripts, they are predominantly localized in the chromatin and nucleus, and a fraction appear to be preferentially processed into small RNAs. They are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences—particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. Importantly, about one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage. Comprehensive analysis of their expression in multiple human organs and brain regions shows that lncRNAs are generally lower expressed than protein-coding genes, and display more tissue-specific expression patterns, with a large fraction of tissue- specific lncRNAs expressed in the brain. Expression correlation analysis indicates that lncRNAs show particularly striking positive correlation with the expression of antisense coding genes. This GENCODE annotation represents a valuable resource for future studies of lncRNAs.},

In this paper, we use a novel relevance measure, called HeteSim, to prioritize candidate disease genes. Two methods based on heterogeneous networks constructed using protein-protein interaction, gene-phenotype associations, and phenotype-phenotype similarity, are presented. In HeteSim MultiPath (HSMP), HeteSim scores of different paths are combined with a constant that dampens the contributions of longer paths. In HeteSim SVM (HSSVM), HeteSim scores are combined with a machine learning method. The 3-fold experiments show that our non-machine learning method HSMP performs better than the existing non-machine learning methods, our machine learning method HSSVM obtains similar accuracy with the best existing machine learning method CATAPULT. From the analysis of the top 10 predicted genes for different diseases, we found that HSSVM avoid the disadvantage of the existing machine learning based methods, which always predict similar genes for different diseases.

The analyzed data demonstrated important differences between complexes of various types of proteins such as transcription factors and nucleases, distinct interaction patterns for the DNA minor groove relative to the major groove and phosphate and importance of water-mediated contacts. Water molecules mediate proportionally the largest number of contacts in the minor groove and form the largest proportion of contacts in complexes of transcription factors.

abstract = {UNLABELLED Chimira is a web-based system for microRNA (miRNA) analysis from small RNA-Seq data. Sequences are automatically cleaned, trimmed, size selected and mapped directly to miRNA hairpin sequences. This generates count-based miRNA expression data for subsequent statistical analysis. Moreover, it is capable of identifying epi-transcriptomic modifications in the input sequences. Supported modification types include multiple types of 3'-modifications (e.g. uridylation, adenylation), 5'-modifications and also internal modifications or variation (ADAR editing or single nucleotide polymorphisms). Besides cleaning and mapping of input sequences to miRNAs, Chimira provides a simple and intuitive set of tools for the analysis and interpretation of the results (see also Supplementary Material). These allow the visual study of the differential expression between two specific samples or sets of samples, the identification of the most highly expressed miRNAs within sample pairs (or sets of samples) and also the projection of the modification profile for specific miRNAs across all samples. Other tools have already been published in the past for various types of small RNA-Seq analysis, such as UEA workbench, seqBuster, MAGI, OASIS and CAP-miRSeq, CPSS for modifications identification. A comprehensive comparison of Chimira with each of these tools is provided in the Supplementary Material. Chimira outperforms all of these tools in total execution speed and aims to facilitate simple, fast and reliable analysis of small RNA-Seq data allowing also, for the first time, identification of global microRNA modification profiles in a simple intuitive interface.

abstract = {The various pathophysiological processes occurring in living systems are known to be orchestrated by delicate interplays and cross-talks between different genes and their regulators. Among the various regulators of genes, there is a class of small non-coding RNA molecules known as microRNAs. Although, the relative simplicity of miRNAs and their ability to modulate cellular processes make them attractive therapeutic candidates, their presence in large numbers make it challenging for experimental researchers to interpret the intricacies of the molecular processes they regulate. Most of the existing bioinformatic tools fail to address these challenges. Here, we present a new web resource 'miRnalyze' that has been specifically designed to directly identify the putative regulation of cell signaling pathways by miRNAs. The tool integrates miRNA-target predictions with signaling cascade members by utilizing TargetScanHuman 7.1 miRNA-target prediction tool and the KEGG pathway database, and thus provides researchers with in-depth insights into modulation of signal transduction pathways by miRNAs. miRnalyze is capable of identifying common miRNAs targeting more than one gene in the same signaling pathway-a feature that further increases the probability of modulating the pathway and downstream reactions when using miRNA modulators. Additionally, miRnalyze can sort miRNAs according to the seed-match types and TargetScan Context ++ score, thus providing a hierarchical list of most valuable miRNAs. Furthermore, in order to provide users with comprehensive information regarding miRNAs, genes and pathways, miRnalyze also links to expression data of miRNAs (miRmine) and genes (TiGER) and proteome abundance (PaxDb) data. To validate the capability of the tool, we have documented the correlation of miRnalyze's prediction with experimental confirmation studies. Database URL http://www.mirnalyze.in.},

The lncRNAs in NONCODE have increased from 210 831 to 527,336. For human and mouse, the lncRNA numbers are 167,150 and 130,558, respectively. NONCODE 2016 has also introduced three important new features: (i) conservation annotation; (ii) the relationships between lncRNAs and diseases; and (iii) an interface to choose high-quality datasets through predicted scores, literature support and long-read sequencing method support. NONCODE is also accessible through http://www.noncode.org/.},

abstract = {Accumulating experimental evidence has indicated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for the regulation of cellular biological processes implicated in many human diseases. However, only relatively few experimentally supported lncRNA-disease associations have been reported. Developing effective computational methods to infer lncRNA-disease associations is becoming increasingly important. Current network-based algorithms typically use a network representation to identify novel associations between lncRNAs and diseases. But these methods are concentrated on specific entities of interest (lncRNAs and diseases) and they do not allow to consider networks with more than two types of entities. Considering the limitations in previous computational methods, we develop a new global network-based framework, LncRDNetFlow, to prioritize disease-related lncRNAs. LncRDNetFlow utilizes a flow propagation algorithm to integrate multiple networks based on a variety of biological information including lncRNA similarity, protein-protein interactions, disease similarity and the associations between them to infer lncRNA-disease associations. We show that LncRDNetFlow performs significantly better than the existing stat-ofthe- art approaches in cross-validation. To further validate the reproducibility of the performance, we use the proposed method to identify the related lncRNAs for ovarian cancer, glioma and cervical cancer. The results are encouraging. Many predicted lncRNAs in the top list have been verified by the biological studies.},

@article{Pan2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play crucial roles in many biological processes, such as post-transcription of gene regulation. ncRNAs mainly function through interaction with RNA binding proteins (RBPs). To understand the function of a ncRNA, a fundamental step is to identify which protein is involved into its interaction. Therefore it is promising to computationally predict RBPs, where the major challenge is that the interaction pattern or motif is difficult to be found. RESULTS In this study, we propose a computational method IPMiner (Interaction Pattern Miner) to predict ncRNA-protein interactions from sequences, which makes use of deep learning and further improves its performance using stacked ensembling. One of the IPMiner's typical merits is that it is able to mine the hidden sequential interaction patterns from sequence composition features of protein and RNA sequences using stacked autoencoder, and then the learned hidden features are fed into random forest models. Finally, stacked ensembling is used to integrate different predictors to further improve the prediction performance. The experimental results indicate that IPMiner achieves superior performance on the tested lncRNA-protein interaction dataset with an accuracy of 0.891, sensitivity of 0.939, specificity of 0.831, precision of 0.945 and Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.784, respectively. We further comprehensively investigate IPMiner on other RNA-protein interaction datasets, which yields better performance than the state-of-the-art methods, and the performance has an increase of over 20 {\%} on some tested benchmarked datasets. In addition, we further apply IPMiner for large-scale prediction of ncRNA-protein network, that achieves promising prediction performance. CONCLUSION By integrating deep neural network and stacked ensembling, from simple sequence composition features, IPMiner can automatically learn high-level abstraction features, which had strong discriminant ability for RNA-protein detection. IPMiner achieved high performance on our constructed lncRNA-protein benchmark dataset and other RNA-protein datasets. IPMiner tool is available at http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/IPMiner .},

The existing method relies on the pronounced period three peaks observed in the Fourier power spectrum of the exon regions which are absent in non-coding regions. The authors have abandoned the four sequences all together and adopted a single 'EIIP indicator sequence' which is formed by substituting the electron-ion interaction pseudopotentials (EIIP) of the nucleotides A, G, C and T in the DNA sequence, reducing the computational overhead by 75{\%}. The power spectrum of this sequence reveals period three peaks for exon regions. Also a number of exons have been identified which exhibit period three peaks when mapped to 'EIIP indicator sequence' and which do not show the same when the binary indicator sequences are employed. We could get better discrimination between exon areas and non-coding areas of a number of genomes when the sequences are mapped to EIIP indicator sequences and the power spectra of the same are taken in a sliding Kaiser window, compared to the existing method using a rectangular window which utilizes binary indicator sequences.},

With the advances in high throughput technologies, a large number of protein-protein interactions are available, which have produced unprecedented opportunities for detecting proteins' essentialities from the network level. There have been a series of computational approaches proposed for predicting essential proteins based on network topologies. However, the network topology-based centrality measures are very sensitive to the robustness of network. Therefore, a new robust essential protein discovery method would be of great value.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: In this paper, we propose a new centrality measure, named PeC, based on the integration of protein-protein interaction and gene expression data. The performance of PeC is validated based on the protein-protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The experimental results show that the predicted precision of PeC clearly exceeds that of the other fifteen previously proposed centrality measures: Degree Centrality (DC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality (CC), Subgraph Centrality (SC), Eigenvector Centrality (EC), Information Centrality (IC), Bottle Neck (BN), Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component (DMNC), Local Average Connectivity-based method (LAC), Sum of ECC (SoECC), Range-Limited Centrality (RL), L-index (LI), Leader Rank (LR), Normalized {\$}\alpha{\$}-Centrality (NC), and Moduland-Centrality (MC). Especially, the improvement of PeC over the classic centrality measures (BC, CC, SC, EC, and BN) is more than 50{\%} when predicting no more than 500 proteins.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the integration of protein-protein interaction network and gene expression data can help improve the precision of predicting essential proteins.

While these new and enigmatic players in the complex transcriptional milieu are encoded by a significant proportion of the genome, their functions are mostly unknown at present. Existing examples suggest that lncRNAs have fulfilled a wide variety of regulatory roles at almost every stage of gene expression. These roles, which encompass signal, decoy, scaffold and guide capacities, derive from folded modular domains in lncRNAs. Early discoveries support a paradigm in which lncRNAs regulate transcription networks via chromatin modulation, but new functions are steadily emerging. Given the biochemical versatility of RNA, lncRNAs may be used for various tasks, including posttranscriptional processing. In addition, long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are strongly enriched for trait-associated SNPs, which suggest a new mechanism by which intergenic trait-associated regions might function. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence increasingly link mutations and dysregulations of lncRNAs to diverse human diseases, especially disorders related to aging. In this article, we review the current state of the knowledge of the lncRNA field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological functions and mechanisms of action of these molecules. We highlight the growing evidence for the importance of lncRNAs in diverse human disorders and the indications that their dysregulations and mutations underlie some aging-related disorders. Finally, we consider the potential medical implications, and future potential in the application of lncRNAs as therapeutic targets and diagnostic markers.},

abstract = {RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism that can make a single base change on specific nucleotide sequence in an RNA transcript. RNA editing events can result in missense codon changes and modulation of alternative splicing in mRNA, and modification of regulatory RNAs and their binding sites in noncoding RNAs. Recent computational studies accurately detected more than 2 million A-to-I RNA editing sites from next-generation sequencing (NGS). However, the vast majority of these RNA editing sites have unknown functions and are in noncoding regions of the genome. To provide a useful resource for the functional effects of RNA editing in long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), we systematically analyzed the A-to-I editing sites in lncRNAs across human, rhesus, mouse, and fly, and observed an appreciable number of RNA editing sites which can significantly impact the secondary structures of lncRNAs and lncRNA-miRNA interactions. All the data were compiled into LNCediting, a user-friendly database (http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/LNCediting/). LNCediting provides customized tools to predict functional effects of novel editing sites in lncRNAs.

As various information and data about lncRNAs are preserved by previous studies, it is appealing to develop novel methods to identify the lncRNAs more accurately. Our method lncRScan-SVM aims at classifying PCTs and LNCTs using support vector machine (SVM). The gold-standard datasets for lncRScan-SVM model training, lncRNA prediction and method comparison were constructed according to the GENCODE gene annotations of human and mouse respectively. By integrating features derived from gene structure, transcript sequence, potential codon sequence and conservation, lncRScan-SVM outperforms other approaches, which is evaluated by several criteria such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and area under curve (AUC). In addition, several known human lncRNA datasets were assessed using lncRScan-SVM. LncRScan-SVM is an efficient tool for predicting the lncRNAs, and it is quite useful for current lncRNA study.},

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of genes at epigenetic, transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, yet what genes are regulated by a specific lncRNA remains to be characterized. To assess the effects of the lncRNA on gene expression, an increasing number of researchers profiled the genome-wide or individual gene expression level change after knocking down or overexpressing the lncRNA. Herein, we describe a curated database named LncRNA2Target, which stores lncRNA-to-target genes and is publicly accessible at http://www.lncrna2target.org. A gene was considered as a target of a lncRNA if it is differentially expressed after the lncRNA knockdown or overexpression. LncRNA2Targetprovides a web interface through which its users can search for the targets of a particular lncRNA or for the lncRNAs that target a particular gene. Both search types are performed either by browsing a provided catalog of lncRNA names or by inserting lncRNA/target gene IDs/names in a search box.},

This study describes an update of the miRTarBase (http://miRTarBase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) that provides information about experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions (MTIs). The latest update of the miRTarBase expanded it to identify systematically Argonaute-miRNA-RNA interactions from 138 crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing (CLIP-seq) data sets that were generated by 21 independent studies. The database contains 4966 articles, 7439 strongly validated MTIs (using reporter assays or western blots) and 348 007 MTIs from CLIP-seq. The number of MTIs in the miRTarBase has increased around 7-fold since the 2014 miRTarBase update. The miRNA and gene expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) are integrated to provide an effective overview of this exponential growth in the miRNA experimental data. These improvements make the miRTarBase one of the more comprehensively annotated, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions databases and motivate additional miRNA research efforts.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: It is popular to explore meaningful molecular targets and infer new functions of genes through gene functional similarity measuring and gene functional network construction. However, little work is available in this field for microRNA (miRNA) genes due to limited miRNA functional annotations. With the rapid accumulation of miRNAs, it is increasingly needed to uncover their functional relationships in a systems level. RESULTS: It is known that genes with similar functions are often associated with similar diseases, and the relationship of different diseases can be represented by a structure of directed acyclic graph (DAG). This is also true for miRNA genes. Therefore, it is feasible to infer miRNA functional similarity by measuring the similarity of their associated disease DAG. Based on the above observations and the rapidly accumulated human miRNA-disease association data, we presented a method to infer the pairwise functional similarity and functional network for human miRNAs based on the structures of their disease relationships. Comparisons showed that the calculated miRNA functional similarity is well associated with prior knowledge of miRNA functional relationship. More importantly, this method can also be used to predict novel miRNA biomarkers and to infer novel potential functions or associated diseases for miRNAs. In addition, this method can be easily extended to other species when sufficient miRNA-associated disease data are available for specific species.

Here we demonstrate that miRNAs are present in the serum and plasma of humans and other animals such as mice, rats, bovine fetuses, calves, and horses. The levels of miRNAs in serum are stable, reproducible, and consistent among individuals of the same species. Employing Solexa, we sequenced all serum miRNAs of healthy Chinese subjects and found over 100 and 91 serum miRNAs in male and female subjects, respectively. We also identified specific expression patterns of serum miRNAs for lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and diabetes, providing evidence that serum miRNAs contain fingerprints for various diseases. Two non-small cell lung cancer-specific serum miRNAs obtained by Solexa were further validated in an independent trial of 75 healthy donors and 152 cancer patients, using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. Through these analyses, we conclude that serum miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers for the detection of various cancers and other diseases.},

abstract = {Understanding the principle of RNA-protein interactions (RPIs) is of critical importance to provide insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation and is useful to guide studies about many complex diseases. The limitations and difficulties associated with experimental determination of RPIs, call an urgent need to computational methods for RPI prediction. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning method to detect RNA-protein interactions based on sequence information. We used motif information and repetitive patterns, which have been extracted from experimentally validated RNA-protein interactions, in combination with sequence composition as descriptors to build a model to RPI prediction via a random forest classifier. About 20{\%} of the "sequence motifs" and "nucleotide composition" features have been selected as the informative features with the feature selection methods. These results suggest that these two feature types contribute effectively in RPI detection. Results of 10-fold cross-validation experiments on three non-redundant benchmark datasets show a better performance of the proposed method in comparison with the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of various performance measures. In addition, the results revealed that the accuracy of the RPI prediction methods could vary considerably across different organisms. We have implemented the proposed method, namely rpiCOOL, as a stand-alone tool with a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that enables the researchers to predict RNA-protein interaction. The rpiCOOL is freely available at http://biocool.ir/rpicool.html for non-commercial uses.},

Exploiting interactions between lncRNAs and mRNA/miRNAs to lncRNA functional similarity (LFS) is an effective method to explore function of lncRNAs and predict novel lncRNA-disease associations. In this article, we proposed an integrative framework, IntNetLncSim, to infer LFS by modeling the information flow in an integrated network that comprises both lncRNA-related transcriptional and post-transcriptional information. The performance of IntNetLncSim was evaluated by investigating the relationship of LFS with the similarity of lncRNA-related mRNA sets (LmRSets) and miRNA sets (LmiRSets). As a result, LFS by IntNetLncSim was significant positively correlated with the LmRSet (Pearson correlation gamma2=0.8424) and LmiRSet (Pearson correlation gamma2=0.2601). Particularly, the performance of IntNetLncSim is superior to several previous methods. In the case of applying the LFS to identify novel lncRNA-disease relationships, we achieved an area under the ROC curve (0.7300) in experimentally verified lncRNA-disease associations based on leave-one-out cross-validation. Furthermore, highly-ranked lncRNA-disease associations confirmed by literature mining demonstrated the excellent performance of IntNetLncSim. Finally, a web-accessible system was provided for querying LFS and potential lncRNA-disease relationships: http://www.bio-bigdata.com/IntNetLncSim.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play essential roles in almost every important biological process through multiple mechanisms. Although the repertoire of human lncRNAs has rapidly expanded, their biological function and regulation remain largely elusive, calling for a systematic and integrative annotation tool. RESULTS Here we present AnnoLnc ( http://annolnc.cbi.pku.edu.cn ), a one-stop portal for systematically annotating novel human lncRNAs. Based on more than 700 data sources and various tool chains, AnnoLnc enables a systematic annotation covering genomic location, secondary structure, expression patterns, transcriptional regulation, miRNA interaction, protein interaction, genetic association and evolution. An intuitive web interface is available for interactive analysis through both desktops and mobile devices, and programmers can further integrate AnnoLnc into their pipeline through standard JSON-based Web Service APIs. CONCLUSIONS To the best of our knowledge, AnnoLnc is the only web server to provide on-the-fly and systematic annotation for newly identified human lncRNAs. Compared with similar tools, the annotation generated by AnnoLnc covers a much wider spectrum with intuitive visualization. Case studies demonstrate the power of AnnoLnc in not only rediscovering known functions of human lncRNAs but also inspiring novel hypotheses.},

abstract = {Accumulating experimental studies have indicated that lncRNAs play important roles in various critical biological process and their alterations and dysregulations have been associated with many important complex diseases. Developing effective computational models to predict potential disease-lncRNA association could benefit not only the understanding of disease mechanism at lncRNA level, but also the detection of disease biomarkers for disease diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention. However, known experimentally confirmed disease-lncRNA associations are still very limited. In this study, a novel model of HyperGeometric distribution for LncRNA-Disease Association inference (HGLDA) was developed to predict lncRNA-disease associations by integrating miRNA-disease associations and lncRNA-miRNA interactions. Although HGLDA didn't rely on any known disease-lncRNA associations, it still obtained an AUC of 0.7621 in the leave-one-out cross validation. Furthermore, 19 predicted associations for breast cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer were verified by biological experimental studies. Furthermore, the model of LncRNA Functional Similarity Calculation based on the information of MiRNA (LFSCM) was developed to calculate lncRNA functional similarity on a large scale by integrating disease semantic similarity, miRNA-disease associations, and miRNA-lncRNA interactions. It is anticipated that HGLDA and LFSCM could be effective biological tools for biomedical research.},

abstract = {Motivation To characterize long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), both identifying and functionally annotating them are essential to be addressed. Moreover, a comprehensive construction for lncRNA annotation is desired to facilitate the research in the field. Results We present LncADeep, a novel lncRNA identification and functional annotation tool. For lncRNA identification, LncADeep integrates intrinsic and homology features into a deep belief network and constructs models targeting both full- and partial-length transcripts. For functional annotation, LncADeep predicts a lncRNA's interacting proteins based on deep neural networks, using both sequence and structure information. Furthermore, LncADeep integrates KEGG and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis and functional module detection with the predicted interacting proteins, and provides the enriched pathways and functional modules as functional annotations for lncRNAs. Test results show that LncADeep outperforms state-of-the-art tools, both for lncRNA identification and lncRNA-protein interaction prediction, and then presents a functional interpretation. We expect that LncADeep can contribute to identifying and annotating novel lncRNAs.

abstract = {The information about the genetic basis of human diseases lies at the heart of precision medicine and drug discovery. However, to realize its full potential to support these goals, several problems, such as fragmentation, heterogeneity, availability and different conceptualization of the data must be overcome. To provide the community with a resource free of these hurdles, we have developed DisGeNET (http://www.disgenet.org), one of the largest available collections of genes and variants involved in human diseases. DisGeNET integrates data from expert curated repositories, GWAS catalogues, animal models and the scientific literature. DisGeNET data are homogeneously annotated with controlled vocabularies and community-driven ontologies. Additionally, several original metrics are provided to assist the prioritization of genotype-phenotype relationships. The information is accessible through a web interface, a Cytoscape App, an RDF SPARQL endpoint, scripts in several programming languages and an R package. DisGeNET is a versatile platform that can be used for different research purposes including the investigation of the molecular underpinnings of specific human diseases and their comorbidities, the analysis of the properties of disease genes, the generation of hypothesis on drug therapeutic action and drug adverse effects, the validation of computationally predicted disease genes and the evaluation of text-mining methods performance.},

However, it performed considerably worse than its non-hierarchical counterpart in spite of using a word tree created using expert knowledge. We introduce a fast hierarchical language model along with a simple feature-based algorithm for automatic construction of word trees from the data. We then show that the resulting models can outperform non-hierarchical neural models as well as the best n-gram models. 1},

abstract = {In the recent few years, an increasing number of studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in many fundamental and important biological processes. As one of pathogenetic factors, the molecular mechanisms underlying human complex diseases still have not been completely understood from the perspective of miRNA. Predicting potential miRNA-disease associations makes important contributions to understanding the pathogenesis of diseases, developing new drugs, and formulating individualized diagnosis and treatment for diverse human complex diseases. Instead of only depending on expensive and time-consuming biological experiments, computational prediction models are effective by predicting potential miRNA-disease associations, prioritizing candidate miRNAs for the investigated diseases, and selecting those miRNAs with higher association probabilities for further experimental validation. In this study, Path-Based MiRNA-Disease Association (PBMDA) prediction model was proposed by integrating known human miRNA-disease associations, miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity for miRNAs and diseases. This model constructed a heterogeneous graph consisting of three interlinked sub-graphs and further adopted depth-first search algorithm to infer potential miRNA-disease associations. As a result, PBMDA achieved reliable performance in the frameworks of both local and global LOOCV (AUCs of 0.8341 and 0.9169, respectively) and 5-fold cross validation (average AUC of 0.9172). In the cases studies of three important human diseases, 88{\%} (Esophageal Neoplasms), 88{\%} (Kidney Neoplasms) and 90{\%} (Colon Neoplasms) of top-50 predicted miRNAs have been manually confirmed by previous experimental reports from literatures. Through the comparison performance between PBMDA and other previous models in case studies, the reliable performance also demonstrates that PBMDA could serve as a powerful computational tool to accelerate the identification of disease-miRNA associations.

Nowadays, many machine learning-based tools have been developed for lncRNA identification. However, many methods predict lncRNAs using sequence-derived features alone, which tend to display unstable performances on different species. Moreover, the majority of tools cannot be re-trained or tailored by users and neither can the features be customized or integrated to meet researchers' requirements. In this study, features extracted from sequence-intrinsic composition, secondary structure and physicochemical property are comprehensively reviewed and evaluated.

LncFinder includes a novel lncRNA predictor using the heterologous features we designed. Experimental results show that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art tools on multiple species with more robust and satisfactory results. Researchers can additionally employ LncFinder to extract various classic features, build classifier with numerous machine learning algorithms and evaluate classifier performance effectively and efficiently. LncFinder can reveal the properties of lncRNA and mRNA from various perspectives and further inspire lncRNA-protein interaction prediction and lncRNA evolution analysis.

abstract = {Recent large-scale analyses of mainly full-length cDNA libraries generated from a variety of mouse tissues indicated that almost half of all representative cloned sequences did not contain an apparent protein-coding sequence, and were putatively derived from non-protein-coding RNA (ncRNA) genes. However, many of these clones were singletons and the majority were unspliced, raising the possibility that they may be derived from genomic DNA or unprocessed pre-mRNA contamination during library construction, or alternatively represent nonspecific "transcriptional noise." Here we show, using reverse transcriptase-dependent PCR, microarray, and Northern blot analyses, that many of these clones were derived from genuine transcripts of unknown function whose expression appears to be regulated. The ncRNA transcripts have larger exons and fewer introns than protein-coding transcripts. Analysis of the genomic landscape around these sequences indicates that some cDNA clones were produced not from terminal poly(A) tracts but internal priming sites within longer transcripts, only a minority of which is encompassed by known genes. A significant proportion of these transcripts exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns, as well as dynamic changes in their expression in macrophages following lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Taken together, the data provide strong support for the conclusion that ncRNAs are an important, regulated component of the mammalian transcriptome.},

abstract = {Methods for detecting nucleotide substitution rates that are faster or slower than expected under neutral drift are widely used to identify candidate functional elements in genomic sequences. However, most existing methods consider either reductions (conservation) or increases (acceleration) in rate but not both, or assume that selection acts uniformly across the branches of a phylogeny. Here we examine the more general problem of detecting departures from the neutral rate of substitution in either direction, possibly in a clade-specific manner. We consider four statistical, phylogenetic tests for addressing this problem: a likelihood ratio test, a score test, a test based on exact distributions of numbers of substitutions, and the genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP) test. All four tests have been implemented in a freely available program called phyloP. Based on extensive simulation experiments, these tests are remarkably similar in statistical power. With 36 mammalian species, they all appear to be capable of fairly good sensitivity with low false-positive rates in detecting strong selection at individual nucleotides, moderate selection in 3-bp elements, and weaker or clade-specific selection in longer elements. By applying phyloP to mammalian multiple alignments from the ENCODE project, we shed light on patterns of conservation/acceleration in known and predicted functional elements, approximate fractions of sites subject to constraint, and differences in clade-specific selection in the primate and glires clades. We also describe new "Conservation" tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser that display both phyloP and phastCons scores for genome-wide alignments of 44 vertebrate species.},

abstract = {Protein-protein interaction (PPI) is one of the most important functional components of a living cell. Recently, researchers have been interested in investigating the correlation between PPI and microRNA, which has been found to be a regulator at the post-transcriptional level. Studies on miRNA-regulated PPI networks will not only facilitate an understanding of the fine tuning role that miRNAs play in PPI networks, but will also provide potential candidates for tumor diagnosis. This review describes basic studies on the miRNA-regulated PPI network in the way of bioinformatics which includes constructing a miRNA-target protein network, describing the features of miRNA-regulated PPI networks and overviewing previous findings based on analysing miRNA-regulated PPI network features.},

abstract = {A fundamental challenge in human health is the identification of disease-causing genes. Recently, several studies have tackled this challenge via a network-based approach, motivated by the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein or functional interactions. However, most of these approaches use only local network information in the inference process and are restricted to inferring single gene associations. Here, we provide a global, network-based method for prioritizing disease genes and inferring protein complex associations, which we call PRINCE. The method is based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. We exploit this function to predict not only genes but also protein complex associations with a disease of interest. We test our method on gene-disease association data, evaluating both the prioritization achieved and the protein complexes inferred. We show that our method outperforms extant approaches in both tasks. Using data on 1,369 diseases from the OMIM knowledgebase, our method is able (in a cross validation setting) to rank the true causal gene first for 34{\%} of the diseases, and infer 139 disease-related complexes that are highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and conservation of their member proteins. Importantly, we apply our method to study three multi-factorial diseases for which some causal genes have been found already: prostate cancer, alzheimer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRINCE's predictions for these diseases highly match the known literature, suggesting several novel causal genes and protein complexes for further investigation.},

Here we introduce RNAcompete, a method for the systematic analysis of RNA binding specificities that uses a single binding reaction to determine the relative preferences of RBPs for short RNAs that contain a complete range of k-mers in structured and unstructured RNA contexts. We tested RNAcompete by analyzing nine diverse RBPs (HuR, Vts1, FUSIP1, PTB, U1A, SF2/ASF, SLM2, RBM4 and YB1). RNAcompete identified expected and previously unknown RNA binding preferences. Using in vitro and in vivo binding data, we demonstrate that preferences for individual 7-mers identified by RNAcompete are a more accurate representation of binding activity than are conventional motif models. We anticipate that RNAcompete will be a valuable tool for the study of RNA-protein interactions.},

abstract = {In more recent years, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been investigated as a new class of regulators of cellular processes, such as cell growth, apoptosis, and carcinogenesis. Although lncRNAs are dysregulated in numerous cancer types, limited data are available on the expression profile and functional role of lncRNAs in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we determined the expression pattern of the growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) in 72 NSCLC specimens by qRT-PCR and assess its biological functions in the development and progression of NSCLC. The results revealed that GAS5 expression was down-regulated in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent noncancerous tissues (P {\textless} 0.05) and was highly related to tumor size and TNM stage (P {\textless} 0.05). This correlation between GAS5 and clinicopathological parameters indicates that GAS5 might function as a tumor suppressor. Furthermore, GAS5 overexpression increased tumor cell growth arrest and induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, siRNA-mediated knockdown of GAS5 promoted tumor cell growth. Importantly, through western blot analysis, we found that ectopic expression of GAS5 significantly up-regulated p53 expression and down-regulated transcription factor E2F1 expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAS5 is a tumor suppressor in NSCLC, and the action of GAS5 is mediated by p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. GAS5 could serve as a potential diagnostic marker for NSCLC and may be a novel therapeutic target in patients with NSCLC.},

abstract = {Computational intelligence techniques have been used in wide applications. Out of numerous computational intelligence techniques, neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) have been playing the dominant roles. However, it is known that both neural networks and SVMs face some challenging issues such as: (1) slow learning speed, (2) trivial human intervene, and/or (3) poor computational scalability. Extreme learning machine (ELM) as emergent technology which overcomes some challenges faced by other techniques has recently attracted the attention from more and more researchers. ELM works for generalized single-hidden layer feedforward networks (SLFNs). The essence of ELM is that the hidden layer of SLFNs need not be tuned. Compared with those traditional computational intelligence techniques, ELM provides better generalization performance at a much faster learning speed and with least human intervene. This paper gives a survey on ELM and its variants, especially on (1) batch learning mode of ELM, (2) fully complex ELM, (3) online sequential ELM, (4) incremental ELM, and (5) ensemble of ELM.},

We were able to reconstruct such patterns by assuming a gene having one codon occurring in about 40{\%} of the sequence. This could indicate that the predominant presence of codons all starting from the same base could confer the observed periodicities. Indeed, it was found that proteins do obey this rule. Implications of this finding in gene evolution are discussed.},

abstract = {NONCODE (http://www.bioinfo.org/noncode/) is an integrated knowledge database dedicated to non-coding RNAs (excluding tRNAs and rRNAs). Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been implied in diseases and identified to play important roles in various biological processes. Since NONCODE version 3.0 was released 2 years ago, discovery of novel ncRNAs has been promoted by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). In this update of NONCODE, we expand the ncRNA data set by collection of newly identified ncRNAs from literature published in the last 2 years and integration of the latest version of RefSeq and Ensembl. Particularly, the number of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has increased sharply from 73 327 to 210 831. Owing to similar alternative splicing pattern to mRNAs, the concept of lncRNA genes was put forward to help systematic understanding of lncRNAs. The 56 018 and 46 475 lncRNA genes were generated from 95 135 and 67 628 lncRNAs for human and mouse, respectively. Additionally, we present expression profile of lncRNA genes by graphs based on public RNA-seq data for human and mouse, as well as predict functions of these lncRNA genes. The improvements brought to the database also include an incorporation of an ID conversion tool from RefSeq or Ensembl ID to NONCODE ID and a service of lncRNA identification. NONCODE is also accessible through http://www.noncode.org/.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION The major signal in coding regions of genomic sequences is a three-base periodicity. Our aim is to use Fourier techniques to analyse this periodicity, and thereby to develop a tool to recognize coding regions in genomic DNA. RESULT The three-base periodicity in the nucleotide arrangement is evidenced as a sharp peak at frequency f = 1/3 in the Fourier (or power) spectrum. From extensive spectral analysis of DNA sequences of total length over 5.5 million base pairs from a wide variety or organisms (including the human genome), and by separately examining coding and non-coding sequences, we find that the relative-height of the peak at f = 1/3 in the Fourier spectrum is a good discriminator of coding potential. This feature is utilized by us to detect probable coding regions in DNA sequences, by examining the local signal-to-noise ratio of the peak within a sliding window. While the overall accuracy is comparable to that of other techniques currently in use, the measure that is presently proposed is independent of training sets or existing database information, and can thus find general application.

abstract = {Identification of essential proteins is very important for understanding the minimal requirements for cellular life and also necessary for a series of practical applications, such as drug design. With the advances in high throughput technologies, a large number of protein-protein interactions are available, which makes it possible to detect proteins' essentialities from the network level. Considering that most species already have a number of known essential proteins, we proposed a new priori knowledge-based scheme to discover new essential proteins from protein interaction networks. Based on the new scheme, two essential protein discovery algorithms, CPPK and CEPPK, were developed. CPPK predicts new essential proteins based on network topology and CEPPK detects new essential proteins by integrating network topology and gene expressions. The performances of CPPK and CEPPK were validated based on the protein interaction network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The experimental results showed that the priori knowledge of known essential proteins was effective for improving the predicted precision. The predicted precisions of CPPK and CEPPK clearly exceeded that of the other 10 previously proposed essential protein discovery methods: Degree Centrality (DC), Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality (CC), Subgraph Centrality (SC), Eigenvector Centrality (EC), Information Centrality (IC), Bottle Neck (BN), Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component (DMNC), Local Average Connectivity-based method (LAC), and Network Centrality (NC). Especially, CPPK achieved 40{\%} improvement in precision over BC, CC, SC, EC, and BN, and CEPPK performed even better. CEPPK was also compared to four other methods (EPC, ORFL, PeC, and CoEWC) which were not node centralities and CEPPK was showed to achieve the best results. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of a cell's regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport, modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of the concept of a gene.},

Recent studies have proposed several methods for RNA-seq of low-quality and/or low-quantity samples, but the relative merits of these methods have not been systematically analyzed. Here we compare five such methods using metrics relevant to transcriptome annotation, transcript discovery and gene expression. Using a single human RNA sample, we constructed and sequenced ten libraries with these methods and compared them against two control libraries. We found that the RNase H method performed best for chemically fragmented, low-quality RNA, and we confirmed this through analysis of actual degraded samples. RNase H can even effectively replace oligo(dT)-based methods for standard RNA-seq. SMART and NuGEN had distinct strengths for measuring low-quantity RNA. Our analysis allows biologists to select the most suitable methods and provides a benchmark for future method development.},

abstract = {As a major class of noncoding RNAs, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in various critical biological processes. Accumulating researches have linked dysregulations and mutations of lncRNAs to a variety of human disorders and diseases. However, to date, only a few human lncRNAs have been associated with diseases. Therefore, it is very important to develop a computational method to globally predict potential associated diseases for human lncRNAs. In this paper, we developed a computational framework to accomplish this by combining human lncRNA expression profiles, gene expression profiles, and human disease-associated gene data. Applying this framework to available human long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) expression data, we showed that the framework has reliable accuracy. As a result, for non-tissue-specific lincRNAs, the AUC of our algorithm is 0.7645, and the prediction accuracy is about 89{\%}. This study will be helpful for identifying novel lncRNAs for human diseases, which will help in understanding the roles of lncRNAs in human diseases and facilitate treatment. The corresponding codes for our method and the predicted results are all available at http://asdcd.amss.ac.cn/MingXiLiu/lncRNA-disease.html.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION A number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified by deep sequencing methods, but their molecular and cellular functions are known only for a limited number of lncRNAs. Current databases on lncRNAs are mostly for cataloging purpose without providing in-depth information required to infer functions. A comprehensive resource on lncRNA function is an immediate need. RESULTS We present a database for functional investigation of lncRNAs that encompasses annotation, sequence analysis, gene expression, protein binding and phylogenetic conservation. We have compiled lncRNAs for six species (human, mouse, zebrafish, fruit fly, worm and yeast) from ENSEMBL, HGNC, MGI and lncRNAdb. Each lncRNA was analyzed for coding potential and phylogenetic conservation in different lineages. Gene expression data of 208 RNA-Seq studies (4995 samples), collected from GEO, ENCODE, modENCODE and TCGA databases, were used to provide expression profiles in various tissues, diseases and developmental stages. Importantly, we analyzed RNA-Seq data to identify coexpressed mRNAs that would provide ample insights on lncRNA functions. The resulting gene list can be subject to enrichment analysis such as Gene Ontology or KEGG pathways. Furthermore, we compiled protein-lncRNA interactions by collecting and analyzing publicly available CLIP-seq or PAR-CLIP sequencing data. Finally, we explored evolutionarily conserved lncRNAs with correlated expression between human and six other organisms to identify functional lncRNAs. The whole contents are provided in a user-friendly web interface. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION lncRNAtor is available at http://lncrnator.ewha.ac.kr/.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Evidence is accumulating that non-coding transcripts, previously thought to be functionally inert, play important roles in various cellular activities. High throughput techniques like next generation sequencing have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of sequence data. It is therefore desirable, not only to discriminate coding and non-coding transcripts, but also to assign the noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts into respective classes (families). Although there are several algorithms available for this task, their classification performance remains a major concern. Acknowledging the crucial role that non-coding transcripts play in cellular processes, it is required to develop algorithms that are able to precisely classify ncRNA transcripts. RESULTS In this study, we initially develop prediction tools to discriminate coding or non-coding transcripts and thereafter classify ncRNAs into respective classes. In comparison to the existing methods that employed multiple features, our SVM-based method by using a single feature (tri-nucleotide composition), achieved MCC of 0.98. Knowing that the structure of a ncRNA transcript could provide insights into its biological function, we use graph properties of predicted ncRNA structures to classify the transcripts into 18 different non-coding RNA classes. We developed classification models using a variety of algorithms (BayeNet, NaiveBayes, MultilayerPerceptron, IBk, libSVM, SMO and RandomForest) and observed that model based on RandomForest performed better than other models. As compared to the GraPPLE study, the sensitivity (of 13 classes) and specificity (of 14 classes) was higher. Moreover, the overall sensitivity of 0.43 outperforms the sensitivity of GraPPLE (0.33) whereas the overall MCC measure of 0.40 (in contrast to MCC of 0.29 of GraPPLE) was significantly higher for our method. This clearly demonstrates that our models are more accurate than existing models. CONCLUSIONS This work conclusively demonstrates that a simple feature, tri-nucleotide composition, is sufficient to discriminate between coding and non-coding RNA sequences. Similarly, graph properties based feature set along with RandomForest algorithm are most suitable to classify different ncRNA classes. We have also developed an online and standalone tool-- RNAcon ( http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/rnacon).},

Through data mining from 2154 datasets of small RNA sequencing data from four species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Danio rerio and Drosophila melanogaster), we have identified 8 749 139 piRNA isoforms from 175 454 canonical piRNAs, and classified them on the basis of variations on 5' or 3' end via the alignment of isoforms with canonical sequence. We thus established a database named IsopiRBank. Each isoforms has detailed annotation as follows: normalized expression data, classification, spatiotemporal expression data and genome origin. Users can also select interested isoforms for further analysis, including target prediction and Enrichment analysis.

This study developed a sequence-based bioinformatics method, LncDisease, to predict the lncRNA-disease associations based on the crosstalk between lncRNAs and miRNAs. Using LncDisease, we predicted the lncRNAs associated with breast cancer and hypertension. The breast-cancer-associated lncRNAs were studied in two breast tumor cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The qRT-PCR results showed that 11 (91.7{\%}) of the 12 predicted lncRNAs could be validated in both breast cancer cell lines. The hypertension-associated lncRNAs were further evaluated in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) stimulated with angiotensin II (Ang II). The qRT-PCR results showed that 3 (75.0{\%}) of the 4 predicted lncRNAs could be validated in Ang II-treated human VSMCs. In addition, we predicted 6 diseases associated with the lncRNA GAS5 and validated 4 (66.7{\%}) of them by literature mining. These results greatly support the specificity and efficacy of LncDisease in the study of lncRNAs in human diseases.

abstract = {Transcriptome studies are revealing that the eukaryotic genome actively transcribes a diverse repertoire of large noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs), many of which are unannotated and distinct from the small RNAs that have garnered much attention in recent years. Why are they so pervasive, and do they have a function? X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a classic epigenetic phenomenon associated with many large ncRNAs. Here, I provide a perspective on how XCI is achieved in mice and suggest how this knowledge can be applied to the rest of the genome. Emerging data indicate that long ncRNAs can function as guides and tethers, and may be the molecules of choice for epigenetic regulation: First, unlike proteins and small RNAs, large ncRNAs remain tethered to the site of transcription, and can therefore uniquely direct allelic regulation. Second, ncRNAs command a much larger sequence space than proteins, and can therefore achieve very precise spatiotemporal control of development. These properties imply that long noncoding transcripts may ultimately rival small RNAs and proteins in their versatility as epigenetic regulators, particularly for locus- and allele-specific control.},

However, experimental verification of microRNA-disease associations is expensive and time-consuming. To overcome the drawbacks of conventional experimental methods, we presented a combinatorial prioritization algorithm to predict the microRNA-disease associations. Importantly, our method can be used to predict microRNAs (diseases) associated with the diseases (microRNAs) without the known associated microRNAs (diseases). The predictive performance of our proposed approach was evaluated and verified by the internal cross-validations and external independent validations based on standard association datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the impressive performance for predicting the microRNA-disease association with the Area Under receiver operation characteristic Curve (AUC), 86.93{\%}, which is indeed outperform the previous prediction methods. Particularly, we observed that the ensemble-based method by integrating the predictions of multiple algorithms can give more reliable and robust prediction than the single algorithm, with the AUC score improved to 92.26{\%}. We applied our combinatorial prioritization algorithm to lung neoplasms and breast neoplasms, and revealed their top 30 microRNA candidates, which are in consistent with the published literatures and databases.},

abstract = {It is a challenge to classify protein-coding or non-coding transcripts, especially those re-constructed from high-throughput sequencing data of poorly annotated species. This study developed and evaluated a powerful signature tool, Coding-Non-Coding Index (CNCI), by profiling adjoining nucleotide triplets to effectively distinguish protein-coding and non-coding sequences independent of known annotations. CNCI is effective for classifying incomplete transcripts and sense-antisense pairs. The implementation of CNCI offered highly accurate classification of transcripts assembled from whole-transcriptome sequencing data in a cross-species manner, that demonstrated gene evolutionary divergence between vertebrates, and invertebrates, or between plants, and provided a long non-coding RNA catalog of orangutan. CNCI software is available at http://www.bioinfo.org/software/cnci.},

abstract = {SUMMARY mRNA/miRNA-seq technology is becoming the leading technology to globally profile gene expression and elucidate the transcriptional regulation mechanisms in living cells. Although there are many tools available for analyzing RNA-seq data, few of them are available as easy accessible online web tools for processing both mRNA and miRNA data for the RNA-seq based user community. As such, we have developed a comprehensive web application tool for processing mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq data. Our web tool wapRNA includes four different modules: mRNA-seq and miRNA-seq sequenced from SOLiD or Solexa platform and all the modules were tested on previously published experimental data. We accept raw sequence data with an optional reads filter, followed by mapping and gene annotation or miRNA prediction. wapRNA also integrates downstream functional analyses such as Gene Ontology, KEGG pathway, miRNA targets prediction and comparison of gene's or miRNA's different expression in different samples. Moreover, we provide the executable packages for installation on user's local server. AVAILABILITY wapRNA is freely available for use at http://waprna.big.ac.cn. The executable packages and the instruction for installation can be downloaded from our web site. CONTACT husn@big.ac.cn; songshh@big.ac.cn.

abstract = {BACKGROUND Current technology has demonstrated that mutation and deregulation of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are associated with diverse human diseases and important biological processes. Therefore, developing a novel computational method for predicting potential ncRNA-disease associations could benefit pathologists in understanding the correlation between ncRNAs and disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. However, only a few studies have investigated these associations in pathogenesis. RESULTS This study utilizes a disease-target-ncRNA tripartite network, and computes prediction scores between each disease-ncRNA pair by integrating biological information derived from pairwise similarity based upon sequence expressions with weights obtained from a multi-layer resource allocation technique. Our proposed algorithm was evaluated based on a 5-fold-cross-validation with optimal kernel parameter tuning. In addition, we achieved an average AUC that varies from 0.75 without link cut to 0.57 with link cut methods, which outperforms a previous method using the same evaluation methodology. Furthermore, the algorithm predicted 23 ncRNA-disease associations supported by other independent biological experimental studies. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these results demonstrate the capability and accuracy of predicting further biological significant associations between ncRNAs and diseases and highlight the importance of adding biological sequence information to enhance predictions.},

abstract = {Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is widely used to specifically silence target gene expression, but its microRNA (miRNA)-like function inevitably suppresses hundreds of off-targets. Recently, complete elimination of the off-target repression has been achieved by introducing an abasic nucleotide to the pivot (position 6; siRNA-6{\O}), of which impaired base pairing destabilizes transitional nucleation (positions 2-6). However, siRNA-6{\O} varied in its conservation of on-target activity (∼80-100{\%}), demanding bioinformatics to discover the principles underlying its on-target efficiency. Analyses of miRNA-target interactions (Ago HITS-CLIP) showed that the stability of transitional nucleation correlated with the target affinity of RNA interference. Furthermore, interrogated analyses of siRNA screening efficiency, experimental data and broadly conserved miRNA sequences showed that the free energy of transitional nucleation (positions 2-5) in siRNA-6{\O} required the range of stability for effective on-target activity (-6 ≤ $\Delta$G[2:5] ≤ -3.5 kcal mol-1). Taking into consideration of these features together with locations, guanine-cytosine content (GC content), nucleotide stretches, single nucleotide polymorphisms and repetitive elements, we implemented a database named 'siAbasic' that provided the list of potent siRNA-6{\O} sequences for most of human and mouse genes (≥ ∼95{\%}), wherein we experimentally validated some of their therapeutic potency. siAbasic will aid to ensure potency of siRNA-6{\O} sequences without concerning off-target effects for experimental and clinical purposes.},

abstract = {The Polycomb group (PcG) protein Eed is implicated in regulation of imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic cells but not of random X inactivation in embryonic cells. The Drosophila homolog of the Eed-Ezh2 PcG protein complex achieves gene silencing through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3-K27), which suggests a role for H3-K27 methylation in imprinted X inactivation. Here we demonstrate that transient recruitment of the Eed-Ezh2 complex to the inactive X chromosome (Xi) occurs during initiation of X inactivation in both extraembryonic and embryonic cells and is accompanied by H3-K27 methylation. Recruitment of the complex and methylation on the Xi depend on Xist RNA but are independent of its silencing function. Together, our results suggest a role for Eed-Ezh2-mediated H3-K27 methylation during initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation and demonstrate that H3-K27 methylation is not sufficient for silencing of the Xi.},

Here, we characterize human lincRNA expression patterns in nine tissues across six mammalian species and multiple individuals. Of the 1898 human lincRNAs expressed in these tissues, we find orthologous transcripts for 80{\%} in chimpanzee, 63{\%} in rhesus, 39{\%} in cow, 38{\%} in mouse, and 35{\%} in rat. Mammalian-expressed lincRNAs show remarkably strong conservation of tissue specificity, suggesting that it is selectively maintained. In contrast, abundant splice-site turnover suggests that exact splice sites are not critical. Relative to evolutionarily young lincRNAs, mammalian-expressed lincRNAs show higher primary sequence conservation in their promoters and exons, increased proximity to protein-coding genes enriched for tissue-specific functions, fewer repeat elements, and more frequent single-exon transcripts. Remarkably, we find that ∼20{\%} of human lincRNAs are not expressed beyond chimpanzee and are undetectable even in rhesus. These hominid-specific lincRNAs are more tissue specific, enriched for testis, and faster evolving within the human lineage.},

However, the mechanisms underlying the dysregulations of miRNAs still have not been fully understood yet. All the previous computational approaches can only predict binary associations between diseases and miRNAs. Predicting multiple types of disease-miRNA associations can further broaden our understanding about the molecular basis of diseases in the level of miRNAs. In this study, the model of Restricted Boltzmann machine for multiple types of miRNA-disease association prediction (RBMMMDA) was developed to predict four different types of miRNA-disease associations. Based on this model, we could obtain not only new miRNA-disease associations, but also corresponding association types. To our knowledge, RBMMMDA is the first model which could computationally infer association types of miRNA-disease pairs. Leave-one-out cross validation was implemented for RBMMMDA and the AUC of 0.8606 demonstrated the reliable and effective performance of RBMMMDA. In the case studies about lung cancer, breast cancer, and global prediction for all the diseases simultaneously, 50, 42, and 45 out of top 100 predicted miRNA-disease association types were confirmed by recent biological experimental literatures, respectively.},

As lncRNA interacts with multiple proteins, predicting lncRNA-protein interactions (lncRPIs) is an important way to study the functions of lncRNA. Up to now, there have been a few works that exploit protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to help the prediction of new lncRPIs. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose to boost the prediction of lncRPIs by fusing multiple protein-protein similarity networks (PPSNs). Concretely, we first construct four PPSNs based on protein sequences, protein domains, protein GO terms and the STRING database respectively, then build a more informative PPSN by fusing these four constructed PPSNs. Finally, we predict new lncRPIs by a random walk method with the fused PPSN and known lncRPIs. Our experimental results show that the new approach outperforms the existing methods. CONCLUSION: Fusing multiple protein-protein similarity networks can effectively boost the performance of predicting lncRPIs.},

abstract = {Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are a new type of non-coding RNAs and are closely related with the occurrence and development of diseases. In previous studies, most lincRNAs have been identified through next-generation sequencing. Because lincRNAs exhibit tissue-specific expression, the reproducibility of lincRNA discovery in different studies is very poor. In this study, not including lincRNA expression, we used the sequence, structural and protein-coding potential features as potential features to construct a classifier that can be used to distinguish lincRNAs from non-lincRNAs. The GA-SVM algorithm was performed to extract the optimized feature subset. Compared with several feature subsets, the five-fold cross validation results showed that this optimized feature subset exhibited the best performance for the identification of human lincRNAs. Moreover, the LincRNA Classifier based on Selected Features (linc-SF) was constructed by support vector machine (SVM) based on the optimized feature subset. The performance of this classifier was further evaluated by predicting lincRNAs from two independent lincRNA sets. Because the recognition rates for the two lincRNA sets were 100{\%} and 99.8{\%}, the linc-SF was found to be effective for the prediction of human lincRNAs.},

Here we discuss the emerging archetypes of molecular functions that lncRNAs execute-as signals, decoys, guides, and scaffolds. For each archetype, examples from several disparate biological contexts illustrate the commonality of the molecular mechanisms, and these mechanistic views provide useful explanations and predictions of biological outcomes. These archetypes of lncRNA function may be a useful framework to consider how lncRNAs acquire properties as biological signal transducers and hint at their possible origins in evolution.

abstract = {The identification of disease-related metabolites is important for a better understanding of metabolite pathological processes in order to improve human medicine. Metabolites, which are the terminal products of cellular regulatory process, can be affected by multi-omic processes. In this work, we propose a powerful method, MetPriCNet, to predict and prioritize disease candidate metabolites based on integrated multi-omics information. MetPriCNet prioritized candidate metabolites based on their global distance similarity with seed nodes in a composite network, which integrated multi-omics information from the genome, phenome, metabolome and interactome. After performing cross-validation on 87 phenotypes with a total of 602 metabolites, MetPriCNet achieved a high AUC value of up to 0.918. We also assessed the performance of MetPriCNet on 18 disease classes and found that 4 disease classes achieved an AUC value over 0.95. Notably, MetPriCNet can also predict disease metabolites without known disease metabolite knowledge. Some new high-risk metabolites of breast cancer were predicted, although there is a lack of known disease metabolite information. A predicted disease metabolic landscape was constructed and analyzed based on the results of MetPriCNet for 87 phenotypes to help us understand the genetic and metabolic mechanism of disease from a global view. },

abstract = {Long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) transcribed from intergenic regions of yeast and animal genomes play important roles in key biological processes. Yet, plant lincRNAs remain poorly characterized and how lincRNA biogenesis is regulated is unclear. Using a reproducibility-based bioinformatics strategy to analyze 200 Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome data sets, we identified 13,230 intergenic transcripts of which 6480 can be classified as lincRNAs. Expression of 2708 lincRNAs was detected by RNA sequencing experiments. Transcriptome profiling by custom microarrays revealed that the majority of these lincRNAs are expressed at a level between those of mRNAs and precursors of miRNAs. A subset of lincRNA genes shows organ-specific expression, whereas others are responsive to biotic and/or abiotic stresses. Further analysis of transcriptome data in 11 mutants uncovered SERRATE, CAP BINDING PROTEIN20 (CBP20), and CBP80 as regulators of lincRNA expression and biogenesis. RT-PCR experiments confirmed these three proteins are also needed for splicing of a small group of intron-containing lincRNAs.},

@article{Kozak1999,
abstract = {The mechanisms whereby ribosomes engage a messenger RNA and select the start site for translation differ between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Initiation sites in polycistronic prokaryotic mRNAs are usually selected via base pairing with ribosomal RNA. That straightforward mechanism is made complicated and interesting by cis- and trans-acting elements employed to regulate translation. Initiation sites in eukaryotic mRNAs are reached via a scanning mechanism which predicts that translation should start at the AUG codon nearest the 5' end of the mRNA. Interest has focused on mechanisms that occasionally allow escape from this first-AUG rule. With natural mRNAs, three escape mechanism ?? context-dependent leaky scanning, reinitiation, and possibly direct internal initiation ?? allow access to AUG codons which, although not first, are still close to the 5' end of the mRNA. This constraint on the initiation step of translation in eukaryotes dictates the location of transcriptional promoters and may have contributed to the evolution of splicing. The binding of Met-tRNA to ribosomes is mediated by a GTP-binding protein in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but the more complex structure of the eukaryotic factor (eIF-2) and its association with other proteins underlie some aspects of initiation unique to eukaryotes. Modulation of GTP hydrolysis by eIF-2 is important during the scanning phase of initiation, while modulating the release of GDP from eIF-2 is a key mechanism for regulating translation in eukaryotes. Our understanding of how some other protein factors participate in the initiation phase of translation is in flux. Genetic tests suggest that some proteins conventionally counted as eukaryotic initiation factors may not be required for translation, while other tests have uncovered interesting new candidates. Some popular ideas about the initiation pathway are predicated on static interactions between isolated factors and mRNA. The need for functional testing of these complexes is discussed. Interspersed with these theoretical topics are some practical points concerning the interpretation of cDNA sequences and the use of in vitro translation systems. Some human diseases resulting from defects in the initiation step of translation are also discussed. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The genomes of large multicellular eukaryotes are mostly comprised of non-protein coding DNA. Although there has been much agreement that a small fraction of these genomes has important biological functions, there has been much debate as to whether the rest contributes to development and/or homeostasis. Much of the speculation has centered on the genomic regions that are transcribed into RNA at some low level. Unfortunately these RNAs have been arbitrarily assigned various names, such as "intergenic RNA," "long non-coding RNAs" etc., which have led to some confusion in the field. Many researchers believe that these transcripts represent a vast, unchartered world of functional non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), simply because they exist. However, there are reasons to question this Panglossian view because it ignores our current understanding of how evolution shapes eukaryotic genomes and how the gene expression machinery works in eukaryotic cells. Although there are undoubtedly many more functional ncRNAs yet to be discovered and characterized, it is also likely that many of these transcripts are simply junk. Here, we discuss how to determine whether any given ncRNA has a function. Importantly, we advocate that in the absence of any such data, the appropriate null hypothesis is that the RNA in question is junk.},

abstract = {Functional micropeptides can be concealed within RNAs that appear to be noncoding. We discovered a conserved micropeptide, which we named myoregulin (MLN), encoded by a skeletal muscle-specific RNA annotated as a putative long noncoding RNA. MLN shares structural and functional similarity with phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), which inhibit SERCA, the membrane pump that controls muscle relaxation by regulating Ca2+ uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). MLN interacts directly with SERCA and impedes Ca2+ uptake into the SR. In contrast to PLN and SLN, which are expressed in cardiac and slow skeletal muscle in mice, MLN is robustly expressed in all skeletal muscle. Genetic deletion of MLN in mice enhances Ca2+ handling in skeletal muscle and improves exercise performance. These findings identify MLN as an important regulator of skeletal muscle physiology and highlight the possibility that additional micropeptides are encoded in the many RNAs currently annotated as noncoding.},

abstract = {Here, we present LNCipedia (http://www.lncipedia.org), a novel database for human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts and genes. LncRNAs constitute a large and diverse class of non-coding RNA genes. Although several lncRNAs have been functionally annotated, the majority remains to be characterized. Different high-throughput methods to identify new lncRNAs (including RNA sequencing and annotation of chromatin-state maps) have been applied in various studies resulting in multiple unrelated lncRNA data sets. LNCipedia offers 21 488 annotated human lncRNA transcripts obtained from different sources. In addition to basic transcript information and gene structure, several statistics are determined for each entry in the database, such as secondary structure information, protein coding potential and microRNA binding sites. Our analyses suggest that, much like microRNAs, many lncRNAs have a significant secondary structure, in-line with their presumed association with proteins or protein complexes. Available literature on specific lncRNAs is linked, and users or authors can submit articles through a web interface. Protein coding potential is assessed by two different prediction algorithms: Coding Potential Calculator and HMMER. In addition, a novel strategy has been integrated for detecting potentially coding lncRNAs by automatically re-analysing the large body of publicly available mass spectrometry data in the PRIDE database. LNCipedia is publicly available and allows users to query and download lncRNA sequences and structures based on different search criteria. The database may serve as a resource to initiate small- and large-scale lncRNA studies. As an example, the LNCipedia content was used to develop a custom microarray for expression profiling of all available lncRNAs.},

The conclusions are supported by: (i) the re-sequencing of the original cell line used by Bibb and Clayton, the LA9 cell line, (ii) the sequencing of a second L-derivative clone (L929), and (iii) the comparison with 12 other mtDNA sequences from live mice, 10 of them maternally related with the mouse from which the L cells were generated. Two of the latest sequences are reported for the first time in this study (Balb/cJ and C57BL/6J). In addition, we found that both the LA9 and L929 mtDNAs also contain private clone polymorphic variants that, at least in the case of L929, promote functional impairment of the oxidative phosphorylation system. Consequently, the mtDNA of the strain used for the mouse genome project (C57BL/6J) is proposed as the new standard for the mouse mtDNA sequence.},

abstract = {Recent transcriptome studies have revealed that a large number of transcripts in mammals and other organisms do not encode proteins but function as noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) instead. As millions of transcripts are generated by large-scale cDNA and EST sequencing projects every year, there is a need for automatic methods to distinguish protein-coding RNAs from noncoding RNAs accurately and quickly. We developed a support vector machine-based classifier, named Coding Potential Calculator (CPC), to assess the protein-coding potential of a transcript based on six biologically meaningful sequence features. Tenfold cross-validation on the training dataset and further testing on several large datasets showed that CPC can discriminate coding from noncoding transcripts with high accuracy. Furthermore, CPC also runs an order-of-magnitude faster than a previous state-of-the-art tool and has higher accuracy. We developed a user-friendly web-based interface of CPC at http://cpc.cbi.pku.edu.cn. In addition to predicting the coding potential of the input transcripts, the CPC web server also graphically displays detailed sequence features and additional annotations of the transcript that may facilitate users' further investigation.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators of diverse biological processes and diseases. However, the combinatorial effects of these molecules in a specific biological function are poorly understood. Identifying co-expressed protein-coding genes of lncRNAs would provide ample insight into lncRNA functions. To facilitate such an effort, we have developed Co-LncRNA, which is a web-based computational tool that allows users to identify GO annotations and KEGG pathways that may be affected by co-expressed protein-coding genes of a single or multiple lncRNAs. LncRNA co-expressed protein-coding genes were first identified in publicly available human RNA-Seq datasets, including 241 datasets across 6560 total individuals representing 28 tissue types/cell lines. Then, the lncRNA combinatorial effects in a given GO annotations or KEGG pathways are taken into account by the simultaneous analysis of multiple lncRNAs in user-selected individual or multiple datasets, which is realized by enrichment analysis. In addition, this software provides a graphical overview of pathways that are modulated by lncRNAs, as well as a specific tool to display the relevant networks between lncRNAs and their co-expressed protein-coding genes. Co-LncRNA also supports users in uploading their own lncRNA and protein-coding gene expression profiles to investigate the lncRNA combinatorial effects. It will be continuously updated with more human RNA-Seq datasets on an annual basis. Taken together, Co-LncRNA provides a web-based application for investigating lncRNA combinatorial effects, which could shed light on their biological roles and could be a valuable resource for this community.

abstract = {Recently, the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have obtained wide attention because they have broad and crucial functions in regulating complex biological processes. Many lncRNAs functioned by interfacing with corresponding RNA binding proteins and the complexity of lncRNAs' function was attributed to multiple lncRNA-protein interactions. To gain insights into the global relationship between lncRNAs and their binding proteins, here we constructed a lncRNA-protein network (LPN) based on experimentally determined functional interactions between them. This network included 177 lncRNAs, 92 proteins and 683 relationships between them. Cluster analysis of LPN revealed that some proteins (such as AGO and IGFBP families) and lncRNA (such as XIST and MALAT1) were densely connected, suggesting the potential co-regulated mechanism and functional cross-talk of different lncRNAs. We then characterized the lncRNA functions and found that lncRNA binding proteins (LBPs) enriched in many cancer or cancer-related pathways. Finally, we investigated the different topological properties of LBPs in PPIs network. Compared with disease proteins and average ones, LBPs tend to have significantly higher degree, betweenness, and closeness but a relatively lower clustering coefficient, indicating their centrality and essentiality in the context of a biological network.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Proteins have the fundamental ability to selectively bind to other molecules and perform specific functions through such interactions, such as protein-ligand binding. Accurate prediction of protein residues that physically bind to ligands is important for drug design and protein docking studies. Most of the successful protein-ligand binding predictions were based on known structures. However, structural information is not largely available in practice due to the huge gap between the number of known protein sequences and that of experimentally solved structures. RESULTS This paper proposes a dynamic ensemble approach to identify protein-ligand binding residues by using sequence information only. To avoid problems resulting from highly imbalanced samples between the ligand-binding sites and non ligand-binding sites, we constructed several balanced data sets and we trained a random forest classifier for each of them. We dynamically selected a subset of classifiers according to the similarity between the target protein and the proteins in the training data set. The combination of the predictions of the classifier subset to each query protein target yielded the final predictions. The ensemble of these classifiers formed a sequence-based predictor to identify protein-ligand binding sites. CONCLUSIONS Experimental results on two Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction datasets and the ccPDB dataset demonstrated that of our proposed method compared favorably with the state-of-the-art.

Moreover, a comprehensive construction for lncRNA annotation is desired to facilitate the research in the field. Results We present LncADeep, a novel lncRNA identification and functional annotation tool. For lncRNA identification, LncADeep integrates intrinsic and homology features into a deep belief network and constructs models targeting both full- and partial-length transcripts. For functional annotation, LncADeep predicts a lncRNA's interacting proteins based on deep neural networks, using both sequence and structure information. Furthermore, LncADeep integrates KEGG and Reactome pathway enrichment analysis and functional module detection with the predicted interacting proteins, and provides the enriched pathways and functional modules as functional annotations for lncRNAs. Test results show that LncADeep outperforms state-of-the-art tools, both for lncRNA identification and lncRNA-protein interaction prediction, and then presents a functional interpretation. We expect that LncADeep can contribute to identifying and annotating novel lncRNAs.

Although efforts have been devoted to the development of methodology for predicting PPIs and protein interaction networks, the application of most existing methods is limited because they need information about protein homology or the interaction marks of the protein partners. In the present work, we propose a method for PPI prediction using only the information of protein sequences. This method was developed based on a learning algorithm-support vector machine combined with a kernel function and a conjoint triad feature for describing amino acids. More than 16,000 diverse PPI pairs were used to construct the universal model. The prediction ability of our approach is better than that of other sequence-based PPI prediction methods because it is able to predict PPI networks. Different types of PPI networks have been effectively mapped with our method, suggesting that, even with only sequence information, this method could be applied to the exploration of networks for any newly discovered protein with unknown biological relativity. In addition, such supplementary experimental information can enhance the prediction ability of the method.},

abstract = {Since the completion of the Human Genome Project, it has been widely established that most DNA is not transcribed into proteins. These non-protein-coding regions are believed to be moderators within transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, which play key roles in the onset of diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are generally lacking in conserved motifs typically used for detection and thus hard to identify, but nonetheless present certain characteristic features that can be exploited by bioinformatics methods. By combining lncRNA detection with known miRNA, RNA-binding protein and chromatin interaction, current tools are able to recognize and functionally annotate large number of lncRNAs. This review discusses databases and platforms dedicated to cataloging and annotating lncRNAs, as well as tools geared at discovering novel sequences. We emphasize the issues posed by the diversity of lncRNAs and their complex interaction mechanisms, as well as technical issues such as lack of unified nomenclature. We hope that this wide overview of existing platforms and databases might help guide biologists toward the tools they need to analyze their experimental data, while our discussion of limitations and of current lncRNA-related methods may assist in the development of new computational tools.},

abstract = {With advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, numerous novel transcripts in a large number of organisms have been identified. With the goal of fast, accurate assessment of the coding ability of RNA transcripts, we upgraded the coding potential calculator CPC1 to CPC2. CPC2 runs ∼1000 times faster than CPC1 and exhibits superior accuracy compared with CPC1, especially for long non-coding transcripts. Moreover, the model of CPC2 is species-neutral, making it feasible for ever-growing non-model organism transcriptomes.

abstract = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as a class of important regulators participating in various biological functions and disease processes. With the widespread application of next-generation sequencing technologies, large numbers of lncRNAs have been identified, producing plenty of lncRNA annotation resources in different contexts. However, at present, we lack a comprehensive overview of these lncRNA annotation resources. In this study, we reviewed 24 currently available lncRNA annotation resources referring to {\textgreater} 205 000 lncRNAs in over 50 tissues and cell lines. We characterized these annotation resources from different aspects, including exon structure, expression, histone modification and function. We found many distinct properties among these annotation resources. Especially, these resources showed diverse chromatin signatures, remarkable tissue and cell type dependence and functional specificity. Our results suggested the incompleteness and complementarity of current lncRNA annotations and the necessity of integration of multiple resources to comprehensively characterize lncRNAs. Finally, we developed LNCat (lncRNA atlas, freely available at http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/LNCat/), a user-friendly database that provides a genome browser of lncRNA structures, visualization of different resources from multiple angles and download of different combinations of lncRNA annotations, and supports rapid exploration, comparison and integration of lncRNA annotation resources. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive comparison of numerous lncRNA annotations, and can facilitate understanding of lncRNAs in human disease.},

abstract = {Only a very small fraction of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are well characterized. The evolutionary history of lncRNAs can provide insights into their functionality, but the absence of lncRNA annotations in non-model organisms has precluded comparative analyses. Here we present a large-scale evolutionary study of lncRNA repertoires and expression patterns, in 11 tetrapod species. We identify approximately 11,000 primate-specific lncRNAs and 2,500 highly conserved lncRNAs, including approximately 400 genes that are likely to have originated more than 300 million years ago. We find that lncRNAs, in particular ancient ones, are in general actively regulated and may function predominantly in embryonic development. Most lncRNAs evolve rapidly in terms of sequence and expression levels, but tissue specificities are often conserved. We compared expression patterns of homologous lncRNA and protein-coding families across tetrapods to reconstruct an evolutionarily conserved co-expression network. This network suggests potential functions for lncRNAs in fundamental processes such as spermatogenesis and synaptic transmission, but also in more specific mechanisms such as placenta development through microRNA production.},

abstract = {Structural information is crucial in ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis and functional annotation; nevertheless, how to include such structural data is still a debated problem. Dot-bracket notation is the most common and simple representation for RNA secondary structures but its simplicity leads also to ambiguity requiring further processing steps to dissolve. Here we present BEAR (Brand nEw Alphabet for RNA), a new context-aware structural encoding represented by a string of characters. Each character in BEAR encodes for a specific secondary structure element (loop, stem, bulge and internal loop) with specific length. Furthermore, exploiting this informative and yet simple encoding in multiple alignments of related RNAs, we captured how much structural variation is tolerated in RNA families and convert it into transition rates among secondary structure elements. This allowed us to compute a substitution matrix for secondary structure elements called MBR (Matrix of BEAR-encoded RNA secondary structures), of which we tested the ability in aligning RNA secondary structures. We propose BEAR and the MBR as powerful resources for the RNA secondary structure analysis, comparison and classification, motif finding and phylogeny.},

abstract = {The central dogma of gene expression is that DNA is transcribed into messenger RNAs, which in turn serve as the template for protein synthesis. The discovery of extensive transcription of large RNA transcripts that do not code for proteins, termed long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), provides an important new perspective on the centrality of RNA in gene regulation. Here, we discuss genome-scale strategies to discover and characterize lncRNAs. An emerging theme from multiple model systems is that lncRNAs form extensive networks of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with numerous chromatin regulators and then target these enzymatic activities to appropriate locations in the genome. Consistent with this notion, lncRNAs can function as modular scaffolds to specify higher-order organization in RNP complexes and in chromatin states. The importance of these modes of regulation is underscored by the newly recognized roles of long RNAs for proper gene control across all kingdoms of life.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths and remains an important public health problem worldwide. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly identified regulators of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. However, the role of lncRNAs in lung cancer induced by environmental carcinogens remains largely unknown. In this study, an lncRNA microarray was used to compare the expression profiles of malignantly transformed 16HBE cells (16HBE-T) induced with anti-benzo[a]pyrene-trans-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (anti-BPDE) and normal 16HBE cells (16HBE-N). Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), lncRNA AF118081 was identified as the most significantly overexpressed lncRNA in 16HBE-T cells, lung cancer cells, and patient samples. Cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assayed in 16HBE-T cells following the knockdown of lncRNA AF118081 with small interfering RNA. AF118081 knockdown inhibited cell growth and tumor invasion. An in vivo (nude mouse) model was then used to assay tumor growth, and the downregulation of AF118081 clearly suppressed tumor growth, consistent with the results of the in vitro assays. Together, these findings identify a new oncogenic lncRNA, lncRNA AF118081, in malignantly transformed 16HBE cells. This enhances our understanding of lncRNAs as important regulatory elements in chemical carcinogenesis and potential targets of lung cancer therapies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},
